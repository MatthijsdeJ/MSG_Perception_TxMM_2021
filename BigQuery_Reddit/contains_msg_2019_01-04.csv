High heat, oil, and don't overcrowd the pan. Drier rice where the grains are more easily separable is ideal, this can be achieved by using left over rice or fresh cooked rice which has been spread out on say a sheet pan near a fan and allowed for excess moisture to escape.

Seasoning can vary depending on the style of fried rice you are after. But typically you are looking at a pinch of sugar, soy sauce(s), and maybe some sesame seed oil. Other seasonings may include oyster sauce, fish sauce, white pepper, or anything your heart desires.

A seasoning tip is to add a pinch of chicken bouillon powder. It adds a bit of savoriness through the chicken flavoring and a touch of MSG for that ""authentic"" taste.",MSG,EvolveFX,1,Cooking,2019-01-16 21:25:39 UTC,1

"I was given a bit of an insider tip on how most UK restaurants and takeaways make their rice - and it really does taste like the real deal, so will share - and (hopefully) end your frustration:

Firstly, you must always use rice that has been cooked and cooled overnight in the fridge - it will clump and stick together with freshly cooked rice.

Take your cold rice (say, 2 heaped cups for 2 people?) and put it in a bowl, add a small amount of dark soy sauce (2-3 teaspoons) - this is just for colour, then add 1/4 teaspoon of salt and (ducking for cover because Im sure this is going to generate much vitriol) - a 1/4 teaspoon of MSG.  Its the MSG that takeaways and restaurants add which is the game changer.  I was skeptical, but it DID make a difference.  Obviously I'll leave it up to you as to whether you are comfortable using it. Give it a thorough mix.

Crack an egg into another small bowl, add a tiny pinch of both salt and (cough), MSG and give it a little whisk.

Now add 2 teaspoons of vegetable oil to a preferably non-stick wok or large skillet and heat until the oil ""shimmers"" (the pan should be hot!).  Add your egg and quickly stir and move around the pan to cook - this will only take around 30 seconds.  Next add your rice and let it sit in the hot pan for, say, 20 seconds - then start stirring and mixing and flattening it with the back of your spoon to disperse any lumps.  Keep stir frying, scooping and flattening until its piping hot (about 3-4 minutes) - it will start to smell fantastic.

If you want scallions or chillis, stir fry them for about 30-40 seconds in the hot oil first, push them to one side of the pan and do your scrambled egg, then add the rice as above.

I promise this will rock your world :)

Method: 
Tart
Mix all the ingredients and form it into a ball. Refrigerate for 30 mins. Roll and place it on the tart mould. Trim off the excess.
Refrigerate again for 30 mins (inorder to avoid shrinkage) and poke it with a fork so that it doesn’t rise while it bakes. Now pour in the blueberry pie filling and make a lattice pattern for the top. Chill it again for 20 mins.

Bake the tart for 15 mins at 220*C till the crust turns golden brown.


Once done brush it with the melted apricot jam (for the glaze) and sprinkle some toasted almonds

Ps: I double the recipe for the tart as I want to make a pattern for the top, if you want to keep your tart open just stick with the original measurements.

"Wikipedia suggests that Italians use an oil made from olive oil and Calabrian chilis:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chili_oil#Italy

...I don't know exactly what sort of hot oil's expected for the Roberta's ""bee sting pizza"" you showed, but if I had to hazard a guess it would be that.

Honestly, I suspect that any sort of chili oil made from any chilis in any oil will work, if the intent is just to add a little heat (in addition to the hot soppresata.)

You can make your own chili oil by heating up some vegetable oil and then pouring it over dried chili flakes. I've been known to heat up cheap olive oil (a highly-processed one is best for this, not extra-virgin) and pour it over ""pizza pepper"" flakes to make it. (You have to use a sufficient quantity of chili flakes to keep the oil from incinerating them. Note that it may come out shockingly spicy -- after it cools down you can mix a little of the chili oil with plain oil to dilute it.) It's a common homemade Chinese condiment, so a Google search on ""chili oil"" will turn up many recipes and tutorial videos, some plain, and some with extra ingredients.

Here's a (rather different) store-bought Chinese hot oil topping I like on my pizzas:

http://nymag.com/strategist/article/lao-gan-ma-best-chili-sauce-review.html

https://www.amazon.com/Lao-Gan-Chili-Crisp-Sauce/dp/B0051D84JU

Stores that carry Chinese products should have it -- the brand name is ""Lao Gan Ma"" and the specific product is ""Spicy Chili Crisp"". It's relatively mild as chili oils go (I could eat it all by itself!) and it's loaded with crunchy things (such as black beans) and salt and MSG. It's a whole bunch of comfort-food flavors all at once. But it's probably not remotely like what Roberta's pizza uses.

"I agree with the Worcestershire most definitely! Idk about the soy sauce tho... If you need more acid just add more wine... Or at least change the vinegar type if you like the vinegar. 

Thyme, garlic, butter in addition are also a huge must for me.  

You might disagree with this next part, we all have our preferences. But maybe try to have carrots in at the same time. Theres a certain sweetness carrots impart that sweat onions dont. It fortifies the beef stock and marries well with the wine and Worcestershire. Something like carrots needs to be in from the beginning to add to the over all flavor. If you dont like them, you can cook more on the side to your preference in butter, thyme, and garlic and it wont take away from anything or contrast too harshley. If you add the carrots earlier on, you then wouldnt have to sweat the onions. There are very strong flavors going around in that pot so having a harsher onion flavor marry out with everything else would probably be more beneficial to milder nuances like sweat onions and the faintest introduction of carrots. The sweetest carrots ive found to be reliably consistant and available are bolthouse organic.

Consider coating your meat lightly in season flour when you sear if you want a slightly more bodied sauce.

Edit: everyone keeps suggesting msg... I'm gonna say you dont need it. From beef to Worcestershire, and garlic, with fortified beef stock you have umami pretty well set. Its really a balance game not enough acid- more wine; too weird/out balanced towards acid- more salt; not enough punch- more worcestershire; too simple- more herbs/aromatics.

I dont use it but people are suggesting and I do love tomato paste and beef, it leans more towards an espagnole style sauce but it would be so good, sweet, tangy, thick. I would only suggest you cook out/caramelize the paste rather than just adding it in as is. Then also consider mushrooms as it rounds out the tomato very nicely ( it fortifies as the umami balance)",msg,LazyMai,2,Cooking,2019-02-17 15:34:05 UTC,2

That said how about a nice curry and rice?  It's easy, filling and can easily be vegetation friendly.  There are as many types of curry as there are people who make them.  Here is a super simple version that doesn't require much.  


You'll need:

Curry powder.  Available at many supermarkets.  S&amp;B brand is pretty good.  It comes in a small red and yellow can.  S&amp;B also makes curry roux but that's for sure a different recipe.

One onion cut into small slices

Two carrots

Bell pepper cut into bite size pieces

Two cloves garlic finely chopped

One slice of ginger finely chopped

Salt, pepper and msg (optional)

Half cup of vegetable stock

Half cup coconut milk or a quarter cup of cream.

One tsp of sugar
  
Heat up a pan or wok (better) until a drop of water floats on the surface without sizzling away. Add enough oil to cover the surface.  Toss in the veggies and stir fry until the onions sweat.    Add seasonings along with the garlic and ginger. When they become aromatic add one heaping tsp of curry powder and the sugar. Stir to coat.  Pour in the stock and coconut milk.

"Yes I’m so sorry for the late reply!! 

For the brisket, it sounds weird but I swear just try it. 

Mix oyster sauce with yellow mustard, a small amount of msg and chicken bouillon, (and any other spices you enjoy for example I’ll add garlic and onion powder), coat raw brisket with it and broil the whole thing until it’s crispy on the outside and still a little red on the inside, flip it halfway through, you’ll know it’s ready to be flipped when the side facing up has gotten a nice crisp with a little bit of blackening, (or a lot of you roll that way). Slice it thinly and serve with sticky rice (or just regular rice) and papaya salad. 

I normally mix a little less oyster sauce in than mustard. And the bouillon is just to taste, (though use a little more than you think you should)
Don’t do the coating too thick or it won’t crisp correctly, and I usually marinate the whole thing overnight in the fridge. Oh and the raw brisket should be trimmed down to be somewhat uniform (it doesn’t have to be anywhere near perfect). 
It’s one of the strangest recipes I’ve ever come across but it’s so good. 

Lately I’ve been trying to nail the recipie down with exact measurements but it’s literally so simple. I was never told exact measurements, I just stole the recipie by watching what she took out of the fridge and cabinet so I swear y’all can do it too!! 

And if you do end up trying it please tell me if you liked it! I’d love to hear about more people discovering the dish, or little changes you’ve made to it  :)


As for green papaya salad, I tend to make the more basic version because I like it more without all the accoutrements, (like the little crabs and other things). 

You just shred or chop semi-thin one unripe, hard, green papaya. Smash a couple Thai chili’s until they’re absolutely pulverized, (a mortar and pestle really helps here, and these things may be small but some of them can be ridiculously spicy). Add a few cherry tomatoes (my SIL and MIL like to crush these lightly and they’re actually from Laos so I assume that’s traditional but I prefer them whole). Squeeze in lime juice to taste, (it shouldn’t be too sour but don’t worry because a little sugar can fix it if you add too much) and my in laws all swear you have to add msg as well. After that mix it all up in your bowl with a generous splash of padaek, (Laotian fish sauce). It HAS to be padaek! Papaya salad just doesn’t taste half as good without it. 

I hope you all try one or both of these and tell me about it! :) and that I didn’t ramble on too long, and that my psa about msg isn’t too annoying lol. 


(I swear most of the msg fear was founded in racism, (the same type that once claimed garlic was harmful!) it’s all just part of the U.S.’s long history of viewing the “exotic” cuisine of Asia as dangerous or dirty.

1 tsp salt
20 g milk powder
10 candied cherry (chopped finely)

100 ml water + 20g flour (cook it till it becomes a thich paste) 

Note: When you cook the roux refrigerate it for 4 hours and let it come to room temp before it gets mixed with the dough

Method:
In a bowl I heated the milk  till 110*F along with the sugar and then added the yeast and let it activate for 10 mins. 
In a separate bowl i mixed the flour, milk powder and salt, cherries and 1 tbsp of coconut (leave the rest for the top) and made a hollow center, then added the activated yeast mixture and mixed everything along with 1tbsp butter (leave the other 1tbsp for the top) and the roux (it’s very wet) keep kneeding it till it’s smooth.

"Thank you guys, i’ll just add the recipe. It’s a really really simple one.

Ingredients

1 whole 700 grams chicken with skin, 1 sweet potato, 4 baby potato (cut into halves), a bunch of asparagus, 1 onion ( cut into half),  corn, 5-6 cloves of garlic and half a lime

Marinate:

3 tbsp salt ( sounds a lot but it’s fine), 2 tbsp coarse pepper, 1 tsp cayenne pepper, 1 tbsp garlic powder, 3 tbsp egyptian chili paste (if you don’t have this just use any sauce, sometimes I use hot nandos sauce), 5 tbsp melted salted butter, 2 tbsp mixed dried herb

Method:

Mix all the ingredients in the marinate, should become a thick slurry and then mix it well with the ingredients (specially rub that chicken well, but gently, you don’t wanna tear the skin). Take the cloves of garlic and stuff it inside the chicken. Now take a roasting bag and throw everything together. Cook the chicken at 180*C for 45 mins, then 210*C for 20 mins and then remove it from the bag and place it on a baking tray. Then bake it at 220*C for 5 mins each side. Once it’s cooked turn on the grill in the oven and cook both sides till the skin looks golden and crispy. 

The fat/gravy that’s left over at the end, you can dip your bread with it and enjoy!

"Signed up just for this question!

\--I use MSG all the time--

I pride myself on my cooking so this isn't just a lazy fool's shortcut (though I'm certainly lazy and can make a fool of myself).  People get squicked out about monosodium glutamate.  It's BS from an older xenophobic generation who came up with the nonsense chinese restaurant syndrome.  There is no science, no peer reviewed study that has ever proven the supposed ill effects of MSG.  Bonded Glutamate is everywhere in 'natural' foods cheese, cooked meat, nuts, and basically anything that's savory like olives, sun dried tomatoes, cooked mushrooms, and in pretty much every processed snack.  The MS means a single sodium atom is bonded to G, the glutamate.  When this molecule goes into solution, the sodium separated from the glutamate.  The sodium ion acts exactly like the sodium in NaCl, plain sodium.  That leaves glutamate.  This is one of the most important neurotransmitters in our brains.  It's essentially is a neurotransmitter that acts to excite and stimulate the neurons it binds to.  To my understanding it increases the activity level and electrical impulses in the neuron.  Glutamate is essential for life!  On a interesting side not, there is a chemical that acts in opposite of glutamate, gaba.  Gaba slows down neural activity.  Glutamate and gaba usually exist in a teeter totter relationship.  That is until you have a beer or take sleep med.  Alcohol and other depressants cause in increase in gaba and thus reduce neural activity.  So if you see NYE revellers tonight, just know that discoordination is due to too much gaba.  A good dose of water, waiting for the ethanol to be metabolized according to its half life, and perhaps a good source of glutamate (think of a burger covered with seared mushrooms, a later of melted cheese, and some bacon, perhaps a sprinkle of MSG) will leave them as best well of as possible the next morning.

"My top suggestion would be to replace chili powder with chili puree. Toast whole chilies (I like a combo of guajillo, ancho, and cayenne. I've used cascabel too,) lightly on a pan. Remove stems and seeds and steep in 2c boiled water from a kettle. Use an amount of water appropriate for how many chilies, you want to have a thick puree, which you get by blending, preferably an immersion blender.  

I'll brown up some steak cubes, and brown ground pork and remove. I try to get as much grease rinsed out as I can. Lightly brown onions and garlic. If you like green onions as a garnish, I suggest adding the white parts sliced in this step as well. Then I'll add my peppers, I like poblanos, jalapenos, and serranos. Roast them ahead of time if you want, or don't, but cook them in oil for less time if you roasted them. They should still be firm before your liquid goes in. Add the meat back, and add beef stock, diced tomatoes or whole tomatoes. I prefer the latter because you can crush them into the size you want. We like a few large chunks so that's why I do that. I don't have amounts because people may want more or less liquid. I like a good amount of liquid. Add your chili puree, and add something dark. Usually I'll save a cup of coffee from the morning, and I'll try and make sure I have some kind of dark beer to go in as well. I've done the dark chocolate squares too. Just a lot of early complexity comes from those things. Season what you've got with salt, black pepper, a pinch of white pepper if you've got it, cumin (toasted and ground whole seeds are best,) oregano. Nothing wrong with adding garlic and/or onion powder too, or anything else you enjoy.   

As for the beans, I guess it depends on your cooking time. I don't always simmer my chili all day. But with canned beans I dont add them right at this point as I dont want them too soft. I use 1 can each of pinto, black, and light kidney beans. I've had chili with garbanzo beans too, that was pretty good.  

Always check for seasonings at the end. Dont be afraid to use a pinch of MSG if you have it (fight me.) But I think my favorite and most important step is that I add the juice of one lemon to it when it's nearly done. Limes would make more sense for a lot of people, but anything works.

"Not a sin: Washing cast iron with soap

This came from the old days where soap was made with Lye. Lye *will* strip your seasoning, and is found in oven cleaner, which is frequently recommended for stripping a pan to start the seasoning fresh.

Using modern day dish soap is completely fine. And is actually *good* for your seasoning. The idea is to polymerize the oil by heating it above its smoke point. If a spot of oil hasn't reached this temperature, you want to wash it off anyway. Otherwise it'll form a gummy spot where real seasoning can't form properly.

Not a sin: Using MSG

Monosodium glutamate is a scary sounding word. But MSG is found in all sorts of commonly used foods, such as tomatoes. Nearly every type of cuisine in the world has a ""staple"" ingredient that is a source of naturally-occurring MSG. But for some reason people claim to get sick if it's in powdered form. 

As far as ""MSG sensitivity"", it's never been reproduced in a scientific study. This is where the fear originated from:

&gt;In 1968, an American doctor wrote a letter to the New England Journal of Medicine claiming to have experience symptoms of numbness in the back of neck and a feeling of pressure in the fact and upper chest muscles, which he coined as “Chinese Restaurant Syndrome.”  He suggested this was caused by MSG because of its widespread use in Chinese restaurants, without any study, data or proof.  While the term Chinese Restaurant Syndrome caught on in the U.S., study after study has failed to show any consistent effects among individuals who claim to be “MSG-sensitive” when blindly exposed to fairly high levels of MSG.",MSG,DVNO,50,Cooking,2019-02-14 21:51:41 UTC,2

A roux will provide stabilization for a white sauce, but that's milk and flour, while ranch is a fat in water emulsion. You can try adding ranch mix to white sauce, but that's about as far from ranch dressing as you can get- and is most likely not that palatable.  Sure, try it, but taste it before it goes on the pizza.

On the other hand, if you take ranch and put it in a squeeze bottle with a fine tip, if you drizzle the ranch on the pizza right after it comes out of the oven, the residual heat should warm it without breaking it.",msg,dopnyc,2,Cooking,2019-02-14 02:08:49 UTC,2
"I never used to have a strong opinion about preservatives until I started getting Migraines.

My migraines can be triggered by a number of factors (fluctuations in barometric pressure, changes in hormones, the smell of nicotine) but artificial/synthetic preservatives in food are guaranteed triggers for me.

Nitrates/Nitrites, commonly found in pork products found on the U.S. will give me a migraine like you can't believe. If I have a single bite of bacon that doesn't say, ""Nigrate Free"" on the packaging, it's less than an hour before I want to bludgeon my head open to stop the pain.

Sorbates, Sulfites, Benzoates, Propionates, High Fructose Corn Syrup, MSG, TBHQ and many others are all added to our packeged foods.

A few years ago I only would've recognized two or maybe three of those preservatives. Now I know what they all are because I know what goes into all of my food purely out of necessity.

Now that my diet greatly dictates my quality of life I view my food differently than I used to (funny how that works) and I firmly believe that those chemicals are not good for our bodies.

If my brain knows immediately that I have ingested a foreign chemical and causes me pain as a result; it tells me that preservatives probably aren't good for anyone even if they don't get migraines.

Of course this is to be taken with a grain of salt. We all ingest foods that we probably shouldn't (I'm looking at you cinnamon rolls) so it's probably fine for most people to have some preservatives in their lives, but being aware of how much they are consuming them and trying to limit that consumption is a good idea.

I know that I personally had absolutely no clue as to how many preservatives I was consuming until I literally had to look at every single label of every single product that I was using and I was shocked to find that they were everywhere.

First off, take a crystal or two, put it in your mouth and taste it. I know it might seem trite, but that's basically the flavor that you're adding to your dish - it's not really going to change through cooking.

The taste should be immediately recognizable. Why? It's used in like... a mountain of processed foods. Doritos are a famous example, but either MSG (or something like it) is in most powdered bouillon, KFC, Tony Chachere's Cajun Seasoning, etc.

This is how I personally use MSG:

1. *Use a little to bring out the natural umami in umami-rich ingredients.* If you taste fish sauce or soy sauce, the umami taste is pretty obvious. That's less true of, say, broccoli. [Take a look at this list](https://msgfacts.com/glutamate-in-food/) - if you're using any ingredient that has a free glutamate content over 100mg/100g as a primary ingredient, a small sprinkle of MSG can help bring out its natural flavor.

2. *Use it to balance spicy food.* Even those that love spicy food don't want just a raw Capsaicin taste from chilis. There's a bunch of was to balance that taste - sugar, acid, Sichuan peppercorns, etc. - MSG is one of them.

3. *Use in place of an umami-imparting ingredient like soy sauce.* Back in the 80s in China some families in the countryside couldn't afford soy sauce, and so some would turn to MSG instead.  Nowadays that's not really a problem, but sometimes you want a bit of umami but you don't want the color that soy sauce imparts. Alternatively, suppose you're using fish sauce but the quality you're working with ain't exactly Phu Quoc - a little MSG along with the low quality fish sauce can really work wonders.

Generally, MSG is added near the end of making a dish, as if it reaches temperatures above 150C it can start to degrade. Also, be sure you're not adding too much - for me, it's exceedingly rare to add more than 1/8 tsp to a dish - it's one of those things that if you can immediately notice it in the end product, you've been too aggressive with it.

For Western food, I generally add a bit to Chili con Carne and the cheese sauce for Mac N Cheese.

Another rule of thumb: whenever Kenji from SeriousEats adds fish sauce to a Western recipe which makes you pause and say 'hmm...', you can use MSG instead.  Same function, he's just looking to add a mild umami undertone.",MSG,mthmchris,24,Cooking,2019-01-09 12:43:09 UTC,1
"My go-to seasonings, some of which are guilty pleasures:

• dried onion flakes, dried carrot flakes, and dried celery flakes. These add flavor, color, and texture to things like soups and rice without having to chop up whole vegetables just to small quantities. Onion flakes can go right into anything (even sprinkled on top of dry things) but celery and carrot flakes have to be boiled to soften them up. 

• (echoing several other posters) smoked sweet paprika. Gives anything a mellow smoky taste. (For those times when liquid smoke would be too much.)

• Target's Salt-Free Southwest Chipotle Seasoning. It's a pretty standard onion-paprika-red-and-black-pepper spice mix, but I've never been able to hit that exact note with my homemade spice mixes.

• extra-virgin olive oil. There's a huge difference in flavor between kinds (and most that have crossed national borders have somehow become adulterated or otherwise substandard.) I use a cheap domestic one which tastes fine to me.  It goes into salad dressings, dipping sauces, etc. (and I even mix a little in when I make bread dough.)

• lemon, lime, or orange zest. Buy a small Microplane and zest your citrus before you peel or juice it. If you don't have an immediate use for the zest, you can easily dry it in the oven and save it in a little jar.

• Pink peppercorns. You'll probably need to mail-order them, and boy are they expensive (especially when you consider they're hollow and crush down to almost nothing when you grind them.) But they have an amazing magenta color and a delicate flavor that's kind of lemony, kind of flowery.

• Wild rice. It takes longer to cook (and a different amount of water) than does white rice, so I will occasionally cook some and keep it in the fridge. Then I can throw a little recooked wild rice into whatever rice dish I'm making -- it doesn't take much, since its flavor and texture is so distinctive.

The following four you'll need a Chinese supermarket for:

• Koon Chun Double Black Soy Sauce. This is a Chinese soy sauce with a sort of molasses added (it's not thick, it's just sweet.) You can of course simulate this with plain soy sauce plus brown sugar or molasses. 

• Chinkiang-style black vinegar (any brand.) A little of this mixed into some of the sweet soy sauce and you've got the basis of dumpling dipping sauce (add sesame oil, scallions, ginger juice, etc. to get fancy.)

• Lao Gan Ma Spicy Chili Crisp (a salty, chili-flakes-in-oil condiment from China.) I've made various kinds of chili oil at home but I can't quite duplicate the jarred stuff. It has loads of MSG plus a few crunchy fermented beans that give it a special umami zing.

• Plain old MSG powder. You can buy it in one-pound bags for a couple bucks at any Asian-themed grocery store, and that'll last you years (it never spoils.) If you've never tasted MSG crystals all by themselves, I recommend tasting it at least once in your life so you can say ""Oh, that's why Pringles taste like that!""",MSG,Kibology,2,Cooking,2019-01-18 15:34:37 UTC,1

"Yes, delicious! I am not really a purist. I have to look up ""official"" types of ramen. For me I make what I like using ingredients I have extra.


The key to making it taste good is to have four components.


1 Homemade noodles using alkaline (kansui or diy baked soda)


2 Good broth, this is actually what I skimp on the most. I will use better than bullion in a heartbeat (you need less salt / less tare for instant broth). But a simple dashi can be very very nice as a foundation. 


3 Tare which is the seasoning. I like soy sauce reduced with lots of ginger and some garlic. 


4 Aromatic oil like sesame oil or chile oil or duck fat. 



You know about different types of ramen so maybe you know this info anyway but I post it for anyone following our comments. 


One of my personal favorites using dashi is. 


Dashi Broth 

Miso Tare - I cook ginger garlic miso mirin and scallion down until reduced and very potent. I add msg because the salt is low when adding to unsalted dashi. 


Chile oil. 


Then as toppings I will Blanche a couple baby bok choy. A soft egg or two. If I'm feeling frisky I will put in some shrimp or poached salmon. 



All the ingredients are subtle so nothing gets overwhelmed. Spicy+miso is one of the best combos.

"&gt;May I ask which restaurant you're going to? I've been to more than 300 restaurants in Nothern NJ and the UK, and I've never tasted mango pulp in CTM.

You probably haven't. I've added this to match a specific version of the dish from a specific restaurant which I specifically wanted to recreate. I think you are massively underestimating how diverse Indian restaurant cooking styles are. Every Indian restaurant makes this dish differently and uses very different ingredients.

&gt;Like the mint in the tikka. There's no mint in tikka.

Again, you are missing the scale of variation between different versions of this dish. When I first started making this dish I didn't used to use mint, then I found a couple of different versions that used mint which adds a subtle background note that I recognised from restaurant versions I wanted to recreate. Mint is commonly used in combination with yoghurt in Indian cooking. If you google recipes for chicken tikka you will see that every single recipe is different and uses a different blend of herbs and spices. They only thing they all have in common is that they use yoghurt. If you don't like it, leave it out

&gt;And the pinch of salt. Are you on a low sodium diet? I've never tasted a CTM with this little salt.

I typically add one half teaspoon of salt to my single portion curries. In this dish it was way too salty. This is because there is also salt in the tikka marinade and there is salt in the tandoori masala and the MSG also contains sodium so you don't need as much salt if you are also using MSG. So I use a lot less salt in this curry than I do for other curries. That being said, it goes without saying that you taste and adjust the seasoning at the end of the cooking.

&gt;And the optional MSG. Optional is certainly better than the recipes that omit it entirely, but, there's absolutely nothing optional about MSG in CTM. You can omit and/or play around with a lot of different stuff, but not MSG. CTM absolutely has to contain MSG.

It's optional because not all restaurants use it and some people specifically avoid it. MSG has only really had widespread use in restaurants over the last 20 years or so and this dish emerged in the UK in the 60s so I think you are over exaggerating more than a little. That being said I always use MSG in this dish. Again, Indian Restaurants are varied.

&gt;I think we're at least 3 years away from cracking the restaurant quality CTM at home code.

The only thing you have in an Indian restaurant that you don't have in a typical home kitchen is a high powered gas stove and an industrial tandoor. This does undoubtedly effect what you can achieve. That being said, this recipe describes ingredients and techniques you could find in a commercial Indian restaurant serving this dish but it's important to recognise that you will not find two Indian restaurants that make this dish the same way. The ""authenticity"" is relative to the majority of CTM posts you find on here and on r/food that don't actually use chicken tikka and so aren't really distinguishable from any other variety chicken curry.

I think of any dish in terms of layers - with the highest layer being floral or acidic flavours, the medium layers being the 'normal' flavours of vegetables or starches, and the lowest layer being the meaty or umami layer.

&amp;#x200B;

MSG bolsters that lowest layer - it rounds out the flavour profile of any dish. You can accomplish the same with any umami rich condiment (miso, tomato paste, marmite, for example). MSG is just one way to do that.

It does have a noticeable taste though, so if you add too much, that's all you can taste.

"When I make tomato sauce, I don't usually add meat.  I'll add meat when I'm making the dish later.  What I do is:

A few cans of San Marzano toms, whole, then mushed up by hand in a big bowl (very satisfying to do)

Cook up some garlic and onion in the pot.  Sweat it like a hot yoga class

Add some very thinly sliced carrot, let it start to soften.  

Deglaze with a bit of red wine

Add toms and bring to a mild simmer

Turn heat down and ride that train for the next 4-5 hours, stirring every 15-30 minutes.  The carrots will disappear if you cut them small enough, but lend a lot of sweetness to the sauce.  

For spices, I tend to add a bit of red pepper flake, rosemary, oregano, and basil.  Fresh, if you can.  

The next big secret apart from carrots that I tell people is *fish sauce*.  You may not be into that depending on how you feel about fish.  But traditionally they would add anchovies and cook them into the sauce - this is replacing that.  It adds some amazing umami-ness and brings out the glutamates in the tomato.  If you really don't want to add fish, I would suggest chopping up some mushroom and adding it with the carrots.  Mushrooms also have a lot of glutamates. And maybe toss a bit of MSG in.

"Make miso soup while it's still cold enough outside to enjoy it! Easy peasy. You can get ingredients for a bunch of pots for $20 or less, and you get to feel fancy and just enjoy the gentle fishiness and variety of textures. 

You can get a recipe for basic miso soup anywhere. But generally speaking, you're going to get some wakame, miso paste, dashi mix (basically a mix of bonito flake, yeast, and MSG), silky tofu, and green onion. And even then, most of the soup is not really ""cooked."" You basically make the dashi, put in the miso/bloomed wakame/green onion/cubed silky tofu, let it get hot, and then it's immediately ready to serve. 

If you haven't worked with dried seaweed much before, just keep in mind that it balloons in size once briefly rested (5-10m?) in a mug or bowl of water. So even a couple tbsp dried wakame could make enough for a 5-6 quarts of soup.

This one is distracting, pretty easy, and rewarding. It's not authentic Italian but I'm south asian and we like to add extra spice  when we cook at home.

2. In butter, saute minced garlic and minced red onions. Add shrimp and parsley and maybe dried dill then cook through. Remove shrimp and set aside. 

3. Add vegetable oil, saute a good amount more of minced garlic and chopped onions. Add mushrooms and broccoli or green beans according to cook time. Season as soon as you add the vegetables with a lot of dried thyme, black pepper,  a little dried basil. Salt to taste. When it's done, add shrimp back in. 

4. Sauce is a mix of bechamel and normal Alfredo which doesn't get as greasy when you reheat it. Saute a little mince garlic in butter low heat. Make that into a roux and add milk. 

5. To bechamel add heavy cream and butter. When it's heated, add grated parm. Season with black pepper, cayenne, salt, and nutmeg. I add more cayenne to make it spicy. 

6. Add finished sauce into vegetables and shrimp. Adjust seasonings. Add a little more parsley, red chilli flakes, and a tsp of tomato paste.

"Congratulations! You've learned one of the great unwritten truths of flavor law.

I think of it this way: The basic chemical flavors we can sense with our tongue are salt, acid, sugar, bitterness, and umami (MSG), so getting two to five of those to balance out results in a complex flavor. So often when you've salted your food but it still seems like something's missing, a splash of something acidic (vinegar, lemon juice, tomato paste, etc.) will perk everything up.

The catch is that because acids are very reactive chemicals, they break down when heated in a mixture of other stuff, so you want to add the splash of ""finishing"" acid at the end of cooking. If leftovers are reheated, you may need to add some new ""finishing"" acid.

My personal favorite vinegar is Chinkiang-style black vinegar (from the Chinese grocery store), which is the one that's traditionally used to balance out the other flavors in hot &amp; sour soup.

I also use apple cider vinegar constantly (apples provide a different kind of tartness -- not just the acetic acid that's in every vinegar, but also malic acid which comes from apples.) I use cider vinegar for pickles, salad dressings, and so on, because of its sweet, fruity quality. (White wine vinegar and champagne vinegar are also great for those applications.)

Just stay away from the synthetic ""white vinegar"" (the clear stuff) sold at supermarkets. That's a photo developer, not a food -- it's edible but it's pure acetic acid, so it has a nasty, sharp, ""chemicaly"" flavor compared to the others which contain traces of whatever plants they were made from. (I used to develop three-foot-wide film, which involved working with gallons of acetic acid. To this day, I cannot eat ""salt &amp; vinegar""-flavored potato chips that reek of that same synthetic vinegar.)",MSG,Kibology,5,Cooking,2019-03-03 20:29:32 UTC,3

[Doubanjiang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doubanjiang) fermented bean paste is excellent in stir fries, soups, and other dishes (could be a great secret ingredient in non-Asian soups, stews, meats, veggies).  This can also be used to make [Ma Po Tofu](https://omnivorescookbook.com/authentic-mapo-tofu/). 

[Fermented black beans](http://www.tigersandstrawberries.com/2005/06/26/chinese-fermented-black-beans/) are super strong umami bombs that are the basis for Black Bean Sauce dishes.  A little bit will make your cooking amazing.  Try them as a [stir fry with chicken](https://www.geniuskitchen.com/recipe/authentic-black-bean-chicken-260313) or [steamed with chicken](https://www.finecooking.com/recipe/steamed-chicken-with-preserved-black-beans-and-ginger) or [pork spare ribs](https://pupswithchopsticks.com/chinese-steamed-pork-ribs-black-beans/)(these are what you get at dim sum places). 

Also check out [Korean doenjang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doenjang), basically a Korean version of Japanese miso paste.  It is stronger flavored and richer, and is great to use in sauces, marinades, as part of a miso coleslaw dressing, and in stews.

"Depending on where you live, visit a farmer's market and look at what's really fresh. A burger's basic parts are meat (main portion - flavorful, juicy, savory, salty), bread (starchy, fluffy), lettuce (crunchy, fresh, light), tomato (acidity, slight sweetness), onions (sharp, spicy), pickles (sour, cuts through saltiness), and condiments such as ketchup (same as tomato) and mustard (spiciness). Keep these parts in mind as you consider what you could replace it with, and what sorts of flavors you want to include.

I personally don't think you can go wrong with more than just a high-quality burger patty, seasoned with salt/fresh cracked black pepper/garlic powder/onion powder/paprika (and a touch of MSG if you're down for that) with some generic sesame-seed buns and a good dollop of ketchup. But I think the key of hamburgers is you make them how YOU like them - mustard? pickles? onions?

I think one of my favorite burgers I've ever had used cheese quesadillas for buns, with homemade tortillas, and had a whole fried egg put on top of the meat, with the top ""bun"" on the side for the customer to smash on top of the burger themself. The richness of the egg coated the whole thing, and while it was an absolute mess it was blissfully carby and mouthwateringly savory. ",MSG,garbagecanofficial,2,Cooking,2019-03-25 18:06:20 UTC,3

"&gt;I'm primarily looking for a good substitute

My number one tip is to change this mindset.  Nothing is really going to successfully replace meat (or any other broad category of food like that).  If you want a steak and are craving a steak there isn't going to be a non-meat option that satisfies that craving.  It's the same way that carab or hazelnut or whatever else cant really replace chocolate if that's what you want.

So the best advice is to simply change your mindset.  You're not looking for ingredients that you substitute in for meat, you're not looking for meals that replace meat options.  What you're looking for by and large are delicious meals that happen to not include meat.  And at the same time don't think of this as a healthier or better diet, instead think of it as a lifestyle change.

Now some more specific general advice:

Simply reducing portions of meat is always simple.  If you'd normally add 8 punces of chicken per person to a stir fry cut that down to 4 or even 2 ounces.  If you're out to eat picking a vegetarian main but a meat starter is a great way to indulge without having to go for that 16 oz T bone.  Meat free days are good if you need more firm goals.  Using the most of whatever meat you buy is great too.  Making stock from leftover bones is a fantastic way to get more meat flavor without more meat.  

And some more specific advice.  Indian cooking in general is a great direction to go.  There are tons of great Indian dishes that are meant to be vegetarian, and when done right it never feels like meat is missing or being replaced by something.  Beans and rice are a great way to get your protein, and there are so many different takes on it.

Meat tends to cover the umami flavor in a dish, but mushrooms, Worcestershire, Parmesan, or straight up MSG can cover that base (along with many other ingredients).",MSG,techiesgoboom,8,Cooking,2019-01-18 21:06:54 UTC,1

Your frying technique is fine, if basic, but you're going to want to season the flour a whole lot more. There are seasonings out there besides salt, pepper, and MSG.

"There it goes: 

Step 1: dough

Ingredients:
1/2 kg of flour
1 glass of warm water (~200ml)
1 tablespoon of salt
~ 30-40g of butter (80%+ fat content) - margarine is a big no-no
1 egg

Spare flour to flour board/bowl you're mixing it on/in.

The dough:

Mix flour with salt, add egg and while mixing egg in gradually add water and butter. Knead it into smooth texture (should take 8-10 mins) roll it into semi thick tube shape (think of it like really thick worm) and cut it with floured knife into 4-5 segments. Cover it with cling film or aluminium foul and let it rest for 10-15 mins (don't leave any part exposed to air to not dry dough).

Flour the board and roll a segment to about 4-5mm thick piece. Use glass (can be same as you had water in), dip it in flour and cut round shapes (wider the glass, bigger the pierogi will be). 

Do it just before putting filling in as dough will be drying and becoming crumbly on outside. 


Part 2: Filling

This is the part you can go WILD. 
As long as filling is not too soggy you are limited by imagination. I'll give you example of traditional one from Poland and some ideas but this part is up to you! 

Potatoes and curd cheese filling - aka pierogi ""ruskie"" :

Ingredients:
1/2 kg of mashed potatoes (fresh, lightly warm, no additions) - frozen won't cut it
125-150g of curd cheese (drained)
1 medium to large onion (depends on your liking to onions) - chop it
Bit of salt and pepper (freshly grinded)

The filling:

Start with mixing potatoes with curd cheese adding salt and pepper mixing it like a dough.
On a pan melt butter and drop of oil (to stop butter from burning) and add chopped onions, add pinch of salt and fry till golden/light brown.
Add fried onions to filling you already mixed and mix again. Done.

Other ideas can be : lightly fried minced meat (with salt, peper and garlic), curry, or even fruit (blueberries!, part crushed, part whole, yum! With sweet cream/whipped cream). Just remember, nothing too soggy/watery.

Part 3: The Pierogi.

Now that you have filling and dough it's time to get serious.
Prepare bit of water in advance (50ml will be more than enough) and put your dough circle on your hand flat, add roughly teaspoon of filling in middle and fold it over into kind of crecent shape. Before sealing it, strech edges a bit and dip finger in water to use it as a glue for dough (just the very edges of your dough circle). After you put edges together, give them a pinch around edges to make sure filling is sealed inside. That takes bit of practice, but you'll make it perfect after some time. 

After making your bunch, you can or make more of pierogi or move on to cooking them. If you want to leave them before cooking whole bunch at once, cover them with cloth to slow down drying of dough. 

Part 4: Cooking pierogi and extras:

Boil water with bit of salt and 2-3 spoons of oil (oil is to prevent pierogi sticking to eachother).
When water is boiling, put enough of them inside to be able to stir them. Don't overload pan with pierogi! It will be disastrous. And don't forget to stir them around so they don't stick to bottom.
After about 5mins they should start floating, give them another 2 mins after most are floating and take them out and drain. If they get too sticky in yoir drainer, add bit more oil to water. 
They are ready to go after cooling down!
You can also fry them after draining to light brown colour, even put bit of spices while frying.

As of extras, if you went with traditional recipe i gave you i recommend serving them with one of following:
Sour cream
Pork belly cut into cubes and fried until crispy (put it on a plate with some of that oil!)
Melted butter or lard(if you have home made available or from butchers).
Any souce like mushroom, gravy, etc will go nicely with it as well. 

If you need any more advice, meal ideas from polish cusine or something not clear about recipe, msg me or post here.

Enjoy!

WHAT.  No. No no no no no.  NO ONE touches the food while it's being prepared unless they are cleared by me or my partner. We have a whole rack of knives on the wall as a warning to anyone who would try that.  (Of course, I'm lucky to live away from family, so that common source of meddling isn't here)

You are NOT a monster.  You have been stuck cooking for assholes.  I'm sorry your family sucks - you don't need to cook for them ever, especially if they won't try foods their family member made and will mess with your food as it's cooking.  You don't need to cook for anyone if you don't want to, and you DEFINITELY are not obligated to alter your cooking to accommodate someone in your house (who isn't someone you specifically want to be there).  

That said, if you WANT to host a dinner for people (who aren't jackasses), it is definitely courteous and appropriate to account for food restrictions that are medical or religious in nature, or to at least let them know what will be in the food that may be an issue for them.  But if that isn't working for you, it is entirely okay to order out, eat out, or do a potluck that is more relaxed and less pressure on you.  

You deserve to find people who will appreciate interesting cooking and who will respect your kitchen.  They are out there, but it may take time to find them.  Until then, cook for you.

I'm about as lazy as they come but I'm struggling to think of others. Generally spice blends aren't good for much. You will pretty much always want/need all the component spices... and mixing them in PROPER ratio's for the specific thing your making means you'll have better flavored food for maybe 30 seconds work? Maybe look specifically for blends with MSG added... since I don't keep that around (most kitchens stock soy sauce, worchestershire, or bouquet as a MSG doser)... that'd probably give you the best results based on what it sounds like you're looking for.

  
Oh yeah, merlegerle reminded me of the Indian spice blends. That's the one exception I can think of where I saw a really good cook use blends. Indian cuisine has a bunch of blends that seem to be treated basically like western cuisine treats individual spices... but that's a whole learning experience of its own. I'm sure there's other cultures (probably many in the spice-growing regions)... but of WESTERN spice blends... most are unnecessary and inferior to just keeping a well stocked spice cabinet of pure spices.

"How could this problem be solved by plant-based dieters though?  


The first challenge is proving the condition exists, and there's literally no way to sort a nocebo/placebo effect from a real but vague health issue without some kind of controlled study.  


That's not the same as a flat-out denial that the condition exists, but it is certainly a skeptical approach. Many people believe they have a sensitivity to grains or MSG when very little evidence exists to support it, and those allergies can both be traced back to either a fake claim (in the case of MSG) or a study that didn't hold up to further research (non-gluten wheat sensitivity, though I realize there is a little more complexity to that issue.)  


And to be clear, it doesn't matter whether the person had doubts or a negative attitude going in; changing your diet in a significant way, especially by eliminating things you like, could always have a mental effect that would be challenging to suss out.  


Before we can diagnose the underlying causes of failure to thrive on a vegan diet, we'd need to prove it's a real condition. I'd love to see people like OP recruited for a blinded study. Design would be a challenge of course, as you'd have to manage to blind a patient to the food they're eating, and you also couldn't actually put ethical vegans in an experimental group where they were given a non-vegan diet. But I'd love to see OP and other ""FTT"" vegans sign up for a study where they are given a diet where the food is all blended into a homogenous shake or difficult-to-identify substance, and they eat that diet for several months. They report how they're feeling, and we see if there is truly a detectable difference between the diets in FTT people.   


Of course I believe OP did poorly on the diet, but nocebo effects aren't ""fake."" They're completely real, and can have physical manifestations, and that's especially true with things like lack of energy.",MSG,reallyverytired,6,nutrition,2019-03-20 06:23:12 UTC,3
"You're probably not going to want to hear this, but, as of right now, I don't think a viable recipe exists for making restaurant quality butter chicken at home.  I've worked on it, and, over time, I've gotten closer, and I've figured some things out, but I'm still not there.  I think we're about 3 years away.

So I can't give you a recipe, but I do know what recipes don't work, and what pitfalls to avoid. As you keep your eye out for viable recipes, here are some critical things you should look for:

1. MSG.  Look for msg in the recipe- if it omits it, the recipe is garbage.  Butter chicken/CTM HAS to contain msg. Even it the recipe includes it, but makes it optional, I would still toss the recipe, since is shows a very clear lack of understanding of Indian restaurant food.
2. Fat.  You don't need to use ghee, but you need to go pretty heavy with the butter.  You also want to make sure the marinade for the chicken contains whole milk yogurt.
3. Sugar.  A good recipe will have a quantity of sugar that will make you go ""whoah, that's a lot of sugar"" when you read it.
4. Lots of onions, cooked for a long time.  
5. Incredibly careful sauteing of the garlic- you never want your garlic to color.
6.  A very light hand with the garam masala.  I think you've already figured this out.
7. Your local takeout is probably using cubed chicken breast, but, boneless skinless thighs will give you exponentially more flavor and juiciness. Grilling them over very hot charcoal is extra work, but it will match the tandoor much better than a home oven will.
8. If the recipe comes from a book, it's highly suspect.  Indian restaurant food cooks don't write books.  Eventually this might change, but, right now, the books out there are all from a perspective of Indian food, not Indian restaurant food.
9. American and British butter chickens vary.  The bases you see online are all British, and they can get a little funky, with things like parsnips.  The Brits also tend to like coconut milk, which is nice, but different. I see you're in Canada, which might be American influenced or British, but you should be able to taste coconut milk if your favorite place is using it.

A few drops of soy sauce is actually very good for this in a tomato sauce. Soy sauce contains naturally occurring MSG as a bi-product of the fermentation process.

"I make stew once a week in winter and my method is full-proof for great results.  It's not really novice level but not difficult either, just a little more involved (worth it to me).

I dredge my meat (usually use beef short rib or chuck) in flour and brown it in olive oil in my dutch oven.  Brown on all sides.  Remove from pan and set aside.  Do in batches if you are making a lot and/or pan is small.

Add diced onion, garlic, and celery to pan (you shouldn't have to add any more fat, but can if you need it) and saute a few minutes until onions start to go transparent.
 
Then add 2 Tbsp of tomato paste and stir and cook on medium heat until paste has turned dark and is sizzling on bottom of pan. It should be evenly spread out amongst all the veg. This step is very important and can't be skipped.

Then add stock and wine to the pot to create enough liquid to come up 1/2 way on your meat when it's added back in, say about 3 cups total.

At this point I'll add seasonings (for me, Mrs Dash, pepper, a little MSG, and a little cinnamon), stir it in.  A bay leaf would be good too. Unfortunately I can't add any salt.

Then add meat back in, turn heat to low, partially cover pan, and cook for 90 minutes or so.  This part can be done in the oven if you want, but I always use the stove.

After cooling a bit off heat, I take out the meat and either puree the sauce (with an immersion blender) or run it thru a sieve.  I like smooth sauces (the onions etc have given up their flavor to the sauce, what's left is dross in my opinion). I realize this part is more fuss than most people want to do, but the end result is cookbook-picture-worthy in appearance.

At this point I almost always stop and refigerate the sauce and meat separately overnight and finish (and eat) the stew the next day. The braise-cool-reheat cycle makes meat very tender.

The next day I'll return the sauce (which should be very thick almost jelly like) to a pot on medium heat, add whatever veg I want (carrots always, sometimes parsnip, zucchini in the summer, potato if I'm not doing them separate as mashed, whole mushrooms) and cook for an hour or so until the veg is tender but not mushy.  Obviously add delicate veg (eg zucchini, mushroom) towards the end. Also add the meat back in with 20-25 minutes to go and get it down in the juice.  I also add some chopped parsley at same time as meat. (Add more stock/water if you feel there is not enough sauce, especially if you're going the mashed potato route).

That's it.  If I didn't put potatoes in the stew, I'll serve it with mashed potatoes.  The sauce makes a great gravy.

I like splitting it up into 2 parts. Again the cool and reheat really does a number on the meat, it allows the proteins to relax.",MSG,mismjames,5,Cooking,2019-03-01 09:53:45 UTC,3

"May we have the over all recipe?  


My veggie chili... carrots that have gone through the food processor, diced celery, onion, bell peppers, jalapenos. I start with the carrot pulp. When it looks dry I add the next thing, move that to the side, add the next, and so on. Move everything to the side, add some oil, and then half my home made alton brown inspired chili powered. Cook until you can smell it. Add the rest. Wait a minute or 2 and stir in all in together. I move it all to the side, and turn up the heat. Then I add drained diced or self diced whole tomatoes. I then add the drained off tomato juice and a beer. If I have roasted garlic laying around I add that. When it reaches a boil I add my beans. I find with veggie chili I only want kidney beans and not black beans; but have used those 7 bean mixes too. Canned beans are fine, but dried are cheaper... That cools on low, in a dutch oven, for several hours. Stirred once in a while. Its best the next day. Time in the fright thickens thing up.  


The beans should add some richness to the sauce; but you can add corn chips (note the salt) or corn flour. You can also thicken with corn starch. Or rice broken up in a pice grinder. The two key seasonings to me are Mexican oregano; it had bit; and cumin. The chilis I use will very. I buy them at the asian market, so those little red 'schezwan' peppers are generally a staple.

Are there any foods that aren’t naturally sourced to some degree.  

Many things we considering artificial are processed from fermentation processes. Lysine for example is basically bacteria and corn that is then processed to leave pure lysine. Many artificial flavorings are made from processed wood pulp and other plant sources (just not the same as the plant whose flavor is being replicated).

"Don't cook with mushy rice.

Mix the rice up before putting it in the pan, so at best if clumped not clumped in balls more than an inch in diameter.

The egg should have mixed with the rice forming very small pieces of cooked egg with the rice, nice and dry, moving around really smoothly.

"I've added sauce and cheese to naan and melted it under the broiler on many occasions, but I wouldn't describe it as 'good pizza.'  A huge part of good pizza is the way the cheese melts.  In order to give off it's fat and flavor, cheese needs to bubble, boil and fry.  Broiling cheese only partially melts it and browns and blisters the top, leaving completely unbubbled/unboiled, less flavorful cheese below this blistered top layer. You'll never get as good of a melt under the broiler as you do on a proper pizza where the steam from the raw dough transfers heat up to the cheese and helps it bubble and fry.  Once you parbake dough, be it french bread, an english muffin, or naan, instead of the dough transferring heat to the cheese, it insulates it, and ruins any chance of a good melt.

This is how cheese on previously bake bread, any kind of previously baked bread tends to look:

"Quiche is one of those things you can kind of just make with whatever's in the cupboard, but this is a common recipe I use:

Caramelise 2-3 small to medium onions, adding garlic and maybe shallots when they're 3/4 caramelized. Deglaze with water until the final deglaze, then use balsamic vinegar.

While that's going, break 10-12 large eggs in a bowl, and set aside in fridge. Coarsely grate 1.5-2 cups of sharp cheddar, and 50ish grams of parmasianno regiano. Crumble 25-50 grams of blue cheese and cube 50-100 grams goat feta in the bottom of a pie plate.

When the onions are caramelized (this takes no less than 45 minutes) drape them over the cheese.

Grind fresh pepper onto the eggs. No, more, that's not enough. Keep grinding. Add about 1/4-1/2 teaspoon salt and MSG, to taste. Beat eggs well, then mix in the cheddar and half the Parma. Pour eggs and cheese  into the pan and cover other ingredients well. Sprinkle remaining Parma on top, and bake at 350 for 45-60 minutes or until the top is golden brown and a toothpick comes out clean (I just do it by eye).

I'll often throw whatever leftover meat and veggies I have laying around, but be careful not to add too much moisture with the veggies. Broccoli, bacon, ham, chicken are all good choices, as are spicy peppers.

If it sticks to the pan you didn't use enough butter caramelizing the onions.",MSG,michaelbrews,3,Cooking,2019-04-16 20:37:20 UTC,4

"To over simplify, the way the food industry in many western countries works is that nutrient barren food is often cheaper to produce (primarily because it has a long shelf live, uses preservatives etc) and that low cost is passed on to the consumer. I work in a super market and a single apple at my work is 35p (UK) but for 50p you could get a pack of noodles (super noodles) which are high in additives such as msg. Which would you choose if you were on a tight budget? Similarly many poorer areas are what is referred to as a ""food dessert"" where you don't find much (if any) fresh produce but instead convenience stores and fast food. In some of these places junk food is often sold cheaper than it is in near by affluent areas; the affluent areas absorb the losses and most purchasing is done in poorer areas. So in essence, many poorer people live in an environment where junk food is both normalised and affordable. Also junk food is typically less filling and calorie dense (meaning you need to eat more to be satiated. Therefore, yes poorer people often can afford to over eat due to the way companies target them and unfortunately this also means higher levels of obesity are associated with lower income areas.

Umami is one of the primary tastes along with sweet salty bitter and sour. It is triggered by the amino acid glutamate and it is a measurement of the protein in food.

MSG stands for mono sodium glutamate and it is the sodium salt of the amino acid glutamate. It adds umami to dishes. There was once a racist media scare that blamed MSG in Chinese food to some made up health problems but there is no danger to using MSG anymore than there is to comsuming tomatoes or mushrooms.

"There is no such thing. Unless this ""bonding agent"" refers to contamination (which is worthy of food supply chain investigation), MSG is just a type of salt (technical term salt rather than table salt).

The article linked is abject pseudoscience which separates naturally occuring glutamate from MSG because somehow being attached to sodium changes things. Any first year university chemistry student (hell, even high school chem students) can tell you that when a salt is dissolved (e.g. in saliva or during digestion) you get glutamate back in it's  original ionic form, identical to naturally occuring glutamate).

There are no good quality ""studies"" done on the subject showing effect; the one in the article is typical of RCTs where MSG ""challenge"" given are massively excessive. The sodium in MSG itself is enough to cause an effect. Imagine if you take in several times your recommended daily salt intake in one go or in one meal. Won't you feel dehydrated, palpitations, headaches, etc? The studies often fail to control the fact that if you're avoiding MSG and glutamate rich foods, you tend to favour less fatty, less salty foods and more fibre in diet; is it any surprise at all that a healthy diet makes people feel better? Or that after a night of asian food that was probably cooked in a good amount of fat, wine, and salt it's not really surprising you feel a little bloated?

Most of this started as racism but it seems the pseudoscientific ""chemicals are bad"" camp has caught on.

Since there are lots of natural sources of glutamic acid - tomatoes, aged cheese, anchovies, miso, soy sauce, yeast/hydrolyzed yeast extract - using MSG specifically in its granular form is going to be better if someone can't consume one of those ingredients, or if texture/hydration is an issue or you want to only have one or two specific flavors (like on Doritos chips).

Supermarket tomatoes tend to be picked and shipped green, then ripened via exposure to ethylene gas.  They don't develop the flavors they would on the vine.

If you do get fresh tomatoes, they take a very long cook time due to all the water.  My mom grows her own and they are delicious, but she freezes hers before turning them into tomato sauce.  It removes a very large percentage of the water without much effort or energy.  You can even give them a squeeze at that point if you want them really dry for a dish.

Regarding the blandness, you should add more umami ingredients.  Mushrooms, worcestershire or other fish sauce, or even straight up MSG are good options.  It's a salt as well, but a different type than NaCl.

"I have a small collection of them too. They're fascinating peeks into all these different subcultures from decades ago. They show just how rapidly food culture has changed in the USA (and how changes in the food culture reflect changes in society in general, and even political events.) I'm in my early 50s, so I'm just old enough to remember a lot of the weirdness from the '70s, such as all those pot-luck dinners where the people who didn't know how to cook *always* brought Jell-O ""salad"" with marshmallows and/or green beans in it. (Yes, just like in that first-season ""Simpsons"" episode.) And there was the obsession with pressure cookers in the '50s (and now it's back!), the Hawaiian food craze of the '50s and '60s (I remember when ""sweet &amp; sour"" changed from Hawaiian-style to Chinese-style), the fondue craze of the '70s, and... so... much... Carnation... evaporated... milk.

I'm particularly fond of the Chinese- and Japanese-inspired cookbooks from the '30s through the '50s, when most people in the USA knew nothing about Asian cuisines and you could see those dishes slowly becoming known, through a series of transitional forms designed to make it seem less foreign. (Remember La Choy ""brown gravy""? And those canned fried noodles? In the early days, tofu was ""soybean cheese"", soy sauce was ""Chinese sauce"", and MSG was ""gourmet powder"".)

Speaking of MSG, I even have a cookbook published by a respectable culinary-education institution but sponsored by an MSG manufacturer... literally every recipe has MSG substituted for the salt. You can't get more Mid-Century American than that.

"Well, this is bound to generate some controversy. Bagged flavored chips are just as much a product of traditional cuisine as they are of food science. We tend to consider food science products as ""bad"" and traditional cuisine as ""good."" There is a channel on YouTube where chefs try to replicate food products, like skittles, or cheese-it crackers. It's often somewhat tricky. There's an assumption that junk food, because it's junk, is easy to make. It's really not. A lot of science and research and testing and investment goes into developing these guilty pleasures.

I'm sure pre-made flavoring powders are available through vendors that supply food to restaurants. You could also experiment with making your own. I'm sure a bit of research could reveal some general processes for making flavorings. You can order most of the chemical or ingredients directly, I'd assume, since they are unlikely to be controlled substances where you need a lab number or something to buy it.

Anyway, perhaps look on youtube. There does seem to be something of a genre of videos devoted to replicating fast food and junk food favorites at home, using widely available ingredients.

Another thought is to buy various soup and flavoring bases that come in powdered form from your market, and use that as a type of base to which you might add dried spices, and perhaps some citric acid and sugar to try to get something that will adhere to the hot chip, have a strong ""msg style umami taste we associate with chips, and maybe some kinds of powdered cheese products.

"There are some bone broth companies, usually locally made boutique kind of shops or there's a home delivery one I think. The easiest way I've found to do it is a crock pot. You just need to roast the bones first. If it's a chicken or turkey that was roasted, already done. Then you can just toss in the Crock-Pot full of water for 8-12hrs on low and there you have it. Season to your taste. For beef you want to boil the bones for 10min first and toss out the water, this prevents scum that clouds the broth. Then roast. Then again into the crock pot. probably easier than it sounds. I actually just use a pot, the key with all broth to keeping in clear is to never actually boil the broth, juts a good summer. You get a delicious amber colour that way. It takes a little attn at the start to get it up to temp without going to a boil and keeping it hot enough to stay at a simmer, but once you find the sweet spot you can pretty much leave it alone for all day.
