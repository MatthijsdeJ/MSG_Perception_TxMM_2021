No joke I once ate some take out food that I didn't check the ingredients on (KFC IIRC) and got about 2 pieces in before my eyes were drooping, about 10 minutes later I was asleep and was so for the next 3 hours or so. \\n\\nCurrently I will get a mild headache, and get drowsy and will mostly recover in about 2-3 hours. \\n\\nBut I can tell if there is a specifically added amount in it, for sure. Yes I'm aware it is naturally occurring in small amounts in many food items.\\n\\nYes I'm sure there are people who claim to be adverse to this that and the other and are attention whores, but trust me, it would be far easier to not have to check ingredients for a quarter of the stuff I put in my mouth, or to not have to deal with the consequences when I don't or when I say 'ah fuck it', but I do.\\n\\nI absolutely hate that any Chinese type place I go into I have to ask about it, not be able to trust their answer as they often premake things like eggrolls or use bought in sauces that they don't know the ingredients of, or marinate their meats in an MSG sauce, so even if you specifically request no MSG, you'll often get at least some. Ditto for most soups, fish/turkey/chicken/vegetable/beef stock (liquid and cubes), powdered flavoring packets (such as for sloppy joes, fajitas, taco mix), pain in the ass just to make shitty food taste better than it's ingredients would otherwise allow it to taste.\\n\\nIn short, if you use MSG, I think you're a cheap cheater, and I hate you. And if you specifically fed me that shit while knowing about it, such as talahrama below (+13 for that, really?), I would punch you in the god damn mouth.</td>\n",

Sucks.\\n\\nFrom a cooking perspective, my advice is that you use it to help out the umami in your foods. It definitely enhances the flavor of anything meaty or proteiny as the other redditors have mentioned. But, if you learn how to cook well, you won't need it. Imagine training wheels. It helps you, but you don't necessarily need them. I think it works to make something taste better than it is. Learn to cook better without it. If youre resolved that you will use it, it's helpful in soups like pho, tom yum, stews, etc. I mean, imagine cuponoodles without MSG.</td>\n",

I used to get a mild then decent headache, drowsy, and then I would pass the fuck out. No joke I once ate some take out food that I didn't check the ingredients on (KFC IIRC) and got about 2 pieces in before my eyes were drooping, about 10 minutes later I was asleep and was so for the next 3 hours or so. \\n\\nCurrently I will get a mild headache, and get drowsy and will mostly recover in about 2-3 hours. \\n\\nBut I can tell if there is a specifically added amount in it, for sure. Yes I'm aware it is naturally occurring in small amounts in many food items.\\n\\nYes I'm sure there are people who claim to be adverse to this that and the other and are attention whores, but trust me, it would be far easier to not have to check ingredients for a quarter of the stuff I put in my mouth, or to not have to deal with the consequences when I don't or when I say 'ah fuck it', but I do.\\n\\nI absolutely hate that any Chinese type place I go into I have to ask about it, not be able to trust their answer as they often premake things like eggrolls or use bought in sauces that they don't know the ingredients of, or marinate their meats in an MSG sauce, so even if you specifically request no MSG, you'll often get at least some. Ditto for most soups, fish/turkey/chicken/vegetable/beef stock (liquid and cubes), powdered flavoring packets (such as for sloppy joes, fajitas, taco mix), pain in the ass just to make shitty food taste better than it's ingredients would otherwise allow it to taste.\\n\\nIn short, if you use MSG, I think you're a cheap cheater, and I hate you. And if you specifically fed me that shit while knowing about it, such as talahrama below (+13 for that, really?), I would punch you in the god damn mouth.   \n",

I don't think you'd be encouraging anyone to be putting peanut oil, or shell fish, or bee stings, or dairy, or non kosher, or anything else unwanted by your guest simply because you personally don't think they should think that way. And if you do, yes you're a bad person.\\n\\nAnd mind you the title of the post was \"does this make me a bad person\". If I answer yes, this is suddenly an attack piece on my part?

Seriously, it is disappearing out of food.  It is a cheap trick to get flavor into food when we have tons rich and savory dishes without it.  Look at how much of it is in soups.  the best soups I have ever had have NO MSG!  It is crap.  Try Kosher salt as suggested below.   \n",

We sat blindfolded with noses clamped and were fed various foods. They necessarily had little to no taste. The only discernable difference between samplings (spaced half an hour apart) was whether or not we felt the effects. We did.   \n",

Most food is over-salted and Americans are conditioned to too much salt.  Try going on a bland, salt-free diet for a few weeks and then trying standard salted food.  It's paralyzing to your palate.  Same with returning to foods that are over sweetened.\\n\\nAgain for me, even when completely dissolved, MSG adds a flavor which is very discernible and tastes bad, where salt does not.\\n\\nThere's also this:\\n\\n[While the U.S. FDA states that MSG is generally safe, it acknowledges the seasoning may pose problems for certain individuals. Specifically, asthmatics and people who can tolerate small, but not large, amounts of MSG may be at risk.](http://chinesefood.about.com/od/healthconcerns/p/MSG.htm)   \n",

In other words you can't get it unless you can move earth and sky so good fucking luck, I'd kill 100 homeless hookers to get an ounce of this spice but I can't find anyone who has any.\\n\\nAlso, smoked paprika is great stuff, but Hungarian paprika is better, fuck you if you don't agree.\\n\\n\\n\\n   \n",

I know some people who love it and would eat it in everything if they could, and some people who hate it with a passion (that would be my camp). I'm not sure if the headaches, etc... are caused by low-grade MSG, or if it's something that just happens to some people, or what... just don't forget that it is salt, so you don't want to go overboard.   \n",

It knocks it out of balance.  Anyone with a discerning palate can taste the presence of added MSG in foods.  So unless the MSG is adding some unique and desirable flavor, why use it?\\n\\nCommercial soups, jerkys and snacks taste better when there is no added MSG.  There is another that seems to have a similar effect.  Disonium isonate or something.  Tastes similar to the chemical taste of MSG   \n",

Aside from that, the ingredients look innocent enough, but the seasoning could be the hidden horror here. Monosodium Glutamate is a common ingredient and sodium could be quite high to make sure it tastes delicious enough for you to enjoy it.\\n\\nNot sure which yellow curry you ate, but the yellow curry that is served around here, Kang Karee, ususally comes with potatoes, which are like the only bad veggies (unless you're carbo-loading). I'm a big fan of the red curry. But really, I don't like to worry about health too much when I eat out (long as I'm not gorging on loading french fries). I go out to enjoy myself, not count calories.\\n\\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow_curry   \n",

Do they use as a substitute for salt?  Do they add it to all their meats?  Maybe a few specific dishes, but I have worked in the culinary profession for over ten years.  I understand how flavor works and can combine ingredients that mimic the flavor of salt.  MSG is not necessary and if it was that great, why not use it on ALL your savory dishes?\\n\\nBetter than mom's breast milk.\\n\\nPlus two chefs out of how many?  I have so many cookbooks by pros and none of them mention MSG.  many recommend to avoid it.   \n",

Sometimes I think food must taste differently to me than is does to others.  I am VERY picky about the flavors that I like and dont like, there is very little middle ground.  MSG and tomatoes happen to be two flavors I absolutely detest.   \n",

Secondly I think msg is cancerogenic (I could be wrong), and lastly, everything kinda tastes the same when msg is used.\\nMsg confers a synthetic enhanced flavour which will make all meals taste the same.\\nMight i propose using thai fish sauce instead? It adds wondersful umami to your savoury dishes and kinda acts like a all natural flavour enhancer.   \n",

I doubt it was psychosomatic, especially given that I don't think there's a connection anyway - and after all I've eaten Chinese food many times with no such effects.\\n\\nIt just makes me wonder about the whole thing though, is there any other ingredient used in Chinese food that might have some effect on some people? What else could it be?\\n\\nI just think given my experience - if other people have experience the same it's not surprising that they might have come to this conclusion anyway.\\n\\nCertainly hasn't put me off Chinese food anyway, om nom nom :D   \n",

But it's worth mentioning that in China you pay the doctor to keep you healthy and if you get sick though you *followed the doctor's guidelines* then the doctor will fix you up for free. Healthier than paying the doctor to prescribe some pills when you feel sick, isn't it.   \n",

But at that point it's a lot more than Chinese food and not just the MSG but the fact that there's soy sauce in it. There's a couple of other typical triggers - foods with tyramine, or chocolate, or red wine (or other things with lots of tannins). But it's certainly not limited to food additives, and MSG is no worse than other equivalent amounts of glutamate. But there's something to people with migraines having food triggers.   \n",

Why else would they put yeast in canned soup? Are you saying that it has a totally different effect?   \n",

As others have said, eating salt or MSG affects the way your taste buds perceive other flavors on a chemical level, even if it doesn't alter the chemistry of the other food that is paired with it like a tomato.   \n",

It causes splitting headache and painful swelling when I consume it. As such I have to read labels to avoid it.\\n\\nSo no you are not a bad person but just realize there are those of us who cannot eat it. Oh and no, it does not mean it is bad for your health. Just that some people are allergic to it is all.   \n",

Cyanide is also naturally occurring.  That doesn't mean it's safe to eat.\\n\\nThe problem with MSG is that your body can't really process it.  No metabolic process in your body actually uses MSG, and as others have said some people are allergic to it.    \n",

From personal experience, it burns my mouth.  I detect it right away and I cannot stand anything with MSG in it.\\n\\nUse natural ingredients.  I have been to several chinese restaurants that use no MSG and they have excellent rice.   \n",

There are a number of others that I am not as sensitive to, so I just avoid all preservatives in a better safe than sorry way. \\n\\n\\nAlso, I did not know that about MSG. I have a biweekly doctors appointment, I will ask my doctor about that then. It might be something they put in MSG, or they could be fucking with me. \\n\\nThanks for the info!    \n",

I moved to North America from Europe and I've never seen so many 'unnatral', processed food in my life. Processed cheese? I went nuts with that for a while because it's the first time i've seen it in a store (I know they sell it in Europe too but it's a lot less common and you have to look for it. The MSG scare, of which I have just been informed, must have only happened in America for the most part. In Europe (at least the Germanic region) 'Aromat', essentially salt mixed with MSG and some herbs, is commonplace in all the restaurants and homes.    \n",

The part that hits me the hardest is that I eat at least one bowl of pho a week. I love pho, but I can physically tell if my body has had a large dose of  MSG. I feel terrible after eating banh mi (Vietnamese sandwiches) and feel like passing out after a few hours of eating one. My girlfriend calls them Vietnamese roofies on my behalf.\\n\\nI get the symptoms of extreme fatigue, thirst, hunger shortly after, mild headaches and irritability. I tried really hard to overcome it by eating more of it (i.e. trying to become more immune to it if possible) but I've come to the conclusion that me and lady MSG dont mesh too well. Sucks.\\n\\nFrom a cooking perspective, my advice is that you use it to help out the umami in your foods. It definitely enhances the flavor of anything meaty or proteiny as the other redditors have mentioned. But, if you learn how to cook well, you won't need it. Imagine training wheels. It helps you, but you don't necessarily need them. I think it works to make something taste better than it is. Learn to cook better without it. If youre resolved that you will use it, it's helpful in soups like pho, tom yum, stews, etc. I mean, imagine cuponoodles without MSG.   \n",

Make some caramelized onions in a separate pan and add. Simmer so a fond develops on the bottom, scrape, build fond, scrape, repeat often. Add maggi seasoning and MSG for extra umami goodness.\\n\\nIt's not about the spices for me, it's about making it uber rich and savory.   \n",

What does a yeast infection have to do with anything?\\n\\nI personally don't like the taste of MSG because it makes everything taste like a cheap Chinese restaurant.  I can usually get the same Umami flavor by using black bean sauce or mushrooms.  If you want to sprinkle it on all your food, that's on you.  \\n\\nAs for everything else, I enjoy soy sauce and tomatoes, although I have no idea what one has to do with the other.  I do try to avoid cheese because I'm lactose intolerant.  Never had marmite.   \n",

Well, doritos and all the other snack crap is guilty of that.\\n\\nI'm surprised someone from the Hilton uses it widely.  Most Chinese restaurants here brag about not using it and many consumers go to great lengths to avoid it probably from personal experience like my own.  I've never swelled up from it, but it tastes awful and I can sense a chemical sensation on my palate that eclipses other flavors.\\n\\nDo you have a shaker of it at the table to compliment every dish you make?  Do you ever draw the line and say \"This dish doesn't need any MSG, or is it present in every savory dish you consume?   \n",

Bread it way too much with tonic water mixed in.  Deep fry the hell out of that.  Add straight corn syrup, salt, msg, and faux citrus juice.  Yeah.  About what it sounds like to me.\\n\\nMe, I'd recommend trying out some thai shrimp recipes instead.   \n",

I am also astounded when people will blindly follow things they hear or read about involving anything scientific, considering it is always changing.  I would hope they would realize that the recommendations for how you should break down your calories between fats, carbs, and protein are just that recommendations and aren't just blatantly eat this much of that always.  \\n\\nI also don't see how people just think well low-carb or low-fat is the way to go.  Any diet has it's good and bad parts to it.  A lot of people in the past 20 years have gotten fat off of low-fat diets because through ignorance they don't seem to realize that many low-fat foods are just insanely high in carbs and therefore they don't end up bettering themselves at all.\\n\\nI actually had a friend of mine just straight up tell me MSG will definitely cause cancer and that nobody should ever eat any amount of it.  I told him that is complete bullshit and there's even any amount of studies that would show while it obviously isn't good to have too much of it, it isn't as bad as he seems to think.  Of course he would have none of it and just stuck to his thinking.  The sad part is he is a well educated very smart person, but somehow is like that about these types of things.   \n",

It is extracted from wheat gluten proteins, at least nowadays. it was originally found in Seaweed, but now there are more efficient ways of producing it.\\n\\nAlso, to say it is 100% urban myth isn't entirely true. A few people do have a sensitivity to MSG, mostly of Chinese decent. It is no more common than a allergy though.   \n",

I like soy sauce reduced with lots of ginger and some garlic. \\n\\n\\n4 Aromatic oil like sesame oil or chile oil or duck fat. \\n\\n\\n\\nYou know about different types of ramen so maybe you know this info anyway but I post it for anyone following our comments. \\n\\n\\nOne of my personal favorites using dashi is. \\n\\n\\nDashi Broth \\n\\nMiso Tare - I cook ginger garlic miso mirin and scallion down until reduced and very potent. I add msg because the salt is low when adding to unsalted dashi. \\n\\n\\nChile oil. \\n\\n\\nThen as toppings I will Blanche a couple baby bok choy. A soft egg or two. If I'm feeling frisky I will put in some shrimp or poached salmon. \\n\\n\\n\\nAll the ingredients are subtle so nothing gets overwhelmed. Spicy+miso is one of the best combos. \\n\\n\\n</td>\n",

In this case, I don’t believe there’s any downside to it really. A lot of American MSG, from my understanding, is artificially made and often has a chemical structure that isn’t complete, so it can pick up other components to complete itself, often turning it radical. Source is from some basic research and also the chef at my restaurant who has studied food fairly thoroughly, refuses to use it because it isn’t always easy to obtain truly natural MSG.   \n",

She could tell if it was in foods in larger quantities.  I don't cook with it because I have started developing her issues as I get older (not msg related, but hypertension, etc.)   Not worth it to me.  I know there is msg in natural amounts in lots of foods, but that isn't the same as adding it.  Quantity matters.  For most people, I think it's fine.  For me, it's easy to leave it out.   \n",

It took 4 months of randomly getting sick and tracking ingredient lists to figure out what caused the reaction and I still will occasionally get sick at potlucks when I eat usually \"safe\" food that unexpectedly turns out to have msg in it. And that conclusion was drawn by a physician not myself so feel free to continue discounting anything that goes against your narrative :). I'm not denying a ton of people have bullshit reactions to the Chinese restaurant myth, but you're an idiot if you think that means literally no person can have a reaction to MSG.   \n",

Thanks for the grade 9 science lesson though. Very helpful and not condescending at all. And I'm not talking about a \"oh I'm a little dehydrated and dizzy\" reaction that is mostly bs and mass hysteria against Chinese restaurants. When I eat something with added msg I am violently ill for 4-6 hours after.\\n\\nhttps://naturallysavvy.com/eat/monosodium-glutamate-natural-vs-synthetic/   \n",

They market the produced as 'No *added* msg' leading people to believe that it is msg free, when it is not. They emphasise that it has a 'richer more robust' flavour and imply that that is because it is made with meat when it is in fact due to a high sugar content.\\n\\nA lot of people who recommend it in the belief that it is a quality product closer to something like a demi glace than a stock cube, would not do so if they understood the msg and sugar content.\\n\\nIt seemed worth pointing out in this thread as B than B has been repeatedly recommended as comparable to a homemade stock.

If you’re cooking from scratch, try something like coconut aminos or Worcestershire sauce. Otherwise, that packet of Lipton onion soup mix and can of cream of mushroom soup will fix you right up. \\n\\nI also switched to a cooking my roasts in a pressure cooker and they are AMAZING. I still put in potatoes, onions,and carrots (carrots will get mushy, I like em that way but not for everyone) and mushrooms and a little bit of wine and coconut aminos and some beef broth. I sear it first and then cook it for an hour under pressure. It’s amazing. \\n\\nUmami and salt. They have no compunctions against dumping salt and msg at Denny’s. You can beat them!\\n\\nAlso, I hear there’s a Mississippi version that somebody liked once or twice....   \n",

However, the term 'over-salting' or 'salty' in this context generally refers to the taste, rather than the chemical definition. MSG doesn't taste 'salty'.   \n",

I also know that correlation does not imply causation. I was just making a comment that MSG does give some people migraines. Additionally, many of the studies I have seen have used healthy participants, which would mean people who generally don't get migraines to begin with. MSG may not give the average person a headache, but it is a trigger for migraines. Migraines are not normal headaches.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI ordered food from a Chinese restaurant with a menu claiming not to use MSG. Ate the food. Got the headache. Called and asked annnnnd turns out they do use MSG.  \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI am all for science. I'm also all for avoiding things that leave me unable to function for significant periods of time.    \n",

One more salt and MSG focused and one heavy on the veggies. From there I can bump it up with MSG, some kind of vinegar, Worcester, my homemade mushroom ketchup (a mushroom Worcester), bay leaf, smoked salt, miso, etc depending on what I need. In this case I would do Worcester (maybe a touch of u the mushroom if I feel wild), bayleaf, touch of smoked salt, and apple cider vinegar to get the balance right.\\n\\nCan't give special brand recommendations as I am on another continent.    \n",

A correct amount of salt/sodium chloride also enhances the taste of food, so there must be some link between sodium and tastiness.  \\n\\nYou may hear a lot of things about soy sauce or fish sauce, but you can get the umami taste from things like aged cheese, ripe tomatoes or even browning your meat (which is why seared meat tastes better than boiled - it's called the Maillard reaction).    \n",

Actually either next week or the week after we're planning on sharing how to make a dish that I'm currently obsessed with: a Guizhou dish called Suancai (i.e. Pickled Cabbage) fried tangyuan.\\n\\nWhat it is is black sesame tangyuan, deep fried, then stir fried with suancai, chilis, and MSG. It was weird as hell the first time I tried it (a relatively common reaction) - it's like... every single flavor all at once. But it's addictive as all hell, I order it from a local Guizhou restaurant around here like... weekly.   \n",

MSG and other MSG-type flavor enhancers. Start googling food label ingredients. Anything that makes you ravenous and irrational has got a sweeter as well as something that enhances umami. There are countless methods to label these things without saying the dreaded MSG word.\\n\\nIf I cooked a steak with accent and a steak without, and put them out in piles for guests, they are going to like the one with accent better. Always. I've tested this. You just don't say anything and observe.   \n",

Probably allows it to be saltier than yours is while not tasting as salty. Also MSG or MSG-like stuff's in there for sure. You might want to put carrots in the whole time as aromatics like that add flavor throughout the dish. Oh, and use mushrooms!   \n",

Makes 70 to 80.\\n\\n\\-1.5 lb pork sausage (or regular ground pork if you want to season yourself like I did)\\n\\n\\-1 lb sharp cheddar cheese\\n\\n\\-2 cups Bisquick\\n\\n\\-Season to taste (I used 2tsp each of dried rosemary, thyme, oregano, then 1tsp of lemon pepper seasoning, MSG, salt, pepper)\\n\\n\\-Knead together the sausage/ground pork, spices (if using plain ground pork), and cheese until sufficiently mixed\\n\\n\\- Add Bisquick about half a cup at a time, mixing until fully incorporated\\n\\n\\-Roll into ping pong ball sized balls and place on a baking sheet prepped as you prefer\\n\\n\\-Bake @ 375F until golden brown (about 20 minutes). Serve warm off the sheet or blot the bottom of each on a paper towel to get rid of the grease before moving to a bowl.\\n\\nThese keep refrigerated for up to a month, frozen for 4-5 months.

IDK I feel like there's enough variation where I can't really pinpoint it at anything. Maybe not flavor profile but corn starch is used a lot in marinades. I'd also say the flavoring tends to be lighter.\\n\\nFuzhou is a lil niche but they use MSG a lot, like to use seaweed/kelp, and there's this red rice wine thing that they use to cook.\\n\\nSichuan this is lazy but the Sichuan peppercorns and doubanjiang.\\n\\n\\n\\n   \n",

I am not really a purist. I have to look up \"official\" types of ramen. For me I make what I like using ingredients I have extra.\\n\\n\\nThe key to making it taste good is to have four components.\\n\\n\\n1 Homemade noodles using alkaline (kansui or diy baked soda)\\n\\n\\n2 Good broth, this is actually what I skimp on the most. I will use better than bullion in a heartbeat (you need less salt / less tare for instant broth). But a simple dashi can be very very nice as a foundation. \\n\\n\\n3 Tare which is the seasoning. I like soy sauce reduced with lots of ginger and some garlic. \\n\\n\\n4 Aromatic oil like sesame oil or chile oil or duck fat. \\n\\n\\n\\nYou know about different types of ramen so maybe you know this info anyway but I post it for anyone following our comments. \\n\\n\\nOne of my personal favorites using dashi is. \\n\\n\\nDashi Broth \\n\\nMiso Tare - I cook ginger garlic miso mirin and scallion down until reduced and very potent. I add msg because the salt is low when adding to unsalted dashi. \\n\\n\\nChile oil. \\n\\n\\nThen as toppings I will Blanche a couple baby bok choy. A soft egg or two. If I'm feeling frisky I will put in some shrimp or poached salmon. \\n\\n\\n\\nAll the ingredients are subtle so nothing gets overwhelmed. Spicy+miso is one of the best combos. \\n\\n\\n   \n",

Several years ago, almost everyone stopped putting msg into their food. We'll this bar had stored not 1, not 2 but THREE 55 GALLON drums in a store room. He filled a big container with the extra MSG powder before they threw it out. He secretly puts that stuff in almost everything he cooks for his family and friends. He has a reputation of being the best cook among everyone for his \"secret ingredient\"   \n",
