Sounds like the blind taste tests you participated in were just that-- taste tests. MSG affects the flavor of dishes and can be easily identified by those that are used to looking for it. The useful study model involves consuming it via a pill or something else that bypasses the taste buds, then eating food.  \\n  \\nedit: Not saying you don't feel an effect, but just because you get migraines doesn't mean the MSG caused it.\\n\\n ____NEXT COMMENT____ \\nOK, if you say that you ate MSG, it passed over your taste buds and you swallowed it, and that flavor component was never detected, then there's nothing I can say.\\n\\n ____NEXT COMMENT____ \\nI was under the impression that manufacturers added things like yeast extracts for the sole purpose of sneaking MSG in the food. Why else would they put yeast in canned soup? Are you saying that it has a totally different effect?\\n\\n ____NEXT COMMENT____ \\nHow is MSG artificially adding that flavor? It basically defines umami. It's not really the same thing as artificial sweeteners tasting sweet-- MSG supplies compounds that have the exact flavor. Aside from having an MSG allergy, I see no reason not to use it if it's applicable.\\n\\n ____NEXT COMMENT____ \\nJust let us know if you ever take part in a double-blind study that uses pill/placebo MSG. That's all I have to say. Personally, if I thought I had an MSG reaction, I'd be thrilled at the idea that it could all be psychosomatic because who wants to have a reaction to anything, but I digress.\\n\\n ____NEXT COMMENT____ \\nPerception is more than just psychology. As others have said, eating salt or MSG affects the way your taste buds perceive other flavors on a chemical level, even if it doesn't alter the chemistry of the other food that is paired with it like a tomato.</td>\n",

       "      <td>For breakfast, my favorite cheap, easy, healthy, tasty meal is \"spicy black beans and eggs on whole grain toast\". You can probably guess how it's made, but here's a recipe anyway: \\n\\n* Heat up a bit of olive oil in a pan, and stick your favorite brand of whole grain bread into the toaster. \\n* When the pan is hot, crack an egg into it. Scramble with a spatula until about halfway cooked\\n* Spoon a few dollops of canned black beans and a generous helping of hot sauce right on top. Continue to scramble until done, then scoop the entire mess on top of your toast.\\n\\nBy the way, a notable advantage of whole grain bread is that it has a much longer shelf life than white bread. I go one step further and get \"[double fiber whole wheat](http://www.naturesownbread.com/NAT_Varieties/Variety.cfm?CategoryID=100&amp;amp;ProductID=16)\" which never goes bad. Ever.\\n\\nFried rice is ridiculously easy to make, and cheap to boot. The best part is that it takes advantage of leftover food. There are plenty of recipes out there, but here's a (relatively) short version: \\n\\n* Heat up canola oil in a pan, toss in whatever vegetables and/or meat you want in the rice. This can be leftovers you have from a previous meal, cheap frozen veggies, or those of the fresh variety. \\n* When this stuff is heated, add rice. Leftover rice that has been sitting in the refrigerator actually works better, but fresh rice is okay too. \\n* Stir everything until the rice is completely coated with oil, then push it to the side and crack an egg in the pan. Scramble that motherfucker and mix it with the rice.\\n* Toss in some soy sauce. You can add whatever other spices you think will taste good at this point - I like garlic powder, lemongrass, coriander seed, MSG, or whatever strikes my fancy at the time. Continue to stir everything until the brown from the soy sauce has spread out evenly over the rice, then turn the heat off and prepare to serve.\\n\\nStir-fry is even easier. All you really need to know is: Oil, meats and veggies, soy sauce, spices, maybe sesame oil, a stove, and a pan. Combine all those ingredients and stir. Serve with rice.\\n\\nWe all know that mercury is the sweetest of the heavy metals, and canned tuna is the best source of mercury on the consumer market. It's also cheap, nonperishable, easy to prepare, and otherwise healthy. The laziest option by far is tuna salad, which is a fine sandwich filler. This is just tuna, mayo, chopped celery, and whatever spices you think would taste good.\\n\\nAlso: Peanut butter. I think [this stuff](http://www.amazon.com/Smart-Balance-Natural-Peanut-16-Ounce/dp/B001M22TA4/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=grocery&amp;amp;qid=1280168401&amp;amp;sr=8-1) is really goddamn good tasting, and leagues healthier than Jif, Peter Pan, and the like. But whatever your choice, peanut butter goes on everything, from fruit to bread to crackers to a spoon. One of my favorite applications is the peanut butter, banana, and honey sandwich, which I will not insult you by providing a recipe for.\\n\\nSome other things to investigate that I won't go into because my interest in the subject is fading by the moment: Spaghetti, baked macaroni and cheese, tacos, bean dip, and chicken wings.

I moved to North America from Europe and I've never seen so many 'unnatral', processed food in my life. Processed cheese? I went nuts with that for a while because it's the first time i've seen it in a store (I know they sell it in Europe too but it's a lot less common and you have to look for it. The MSG scare, of which I have just been informed, must have only happened in America for the most part.

That is a crass oversimplification, but it's kinda accurate. Sodium and glutimate act as a something that tastes salty and with some protein flavors.\\n\\nI don't buy in to the health implications. I think they are as fraudulent as the link between immunizations and Autism (both are based on a study that has been proven incorrect, but the lie still lives)\\n\\nThat's choppy and doesn't flow, but I cut myself off a lot when writing that to avoid lengthy tangents that you probably don't care about.   \n",

I picked it up while in Peru.\\n\\n* Romaine\\n* Baby spinach\\n* Olive Oil\\n* Salt\\n* MSG\\n* Black Pepper\\n* Key Limes (you know, the small ones)\\n\\nAll of this is to taste and desired portion, so tear that shit up, spray lightly with olive oil, and season.  I would suggest proportioning the seasonings MSG&gt;Salt&gt;Black pepper.  One squeezed key lime is usually enough for a single serving, but experiment.\\n\\nAnything extra like purple cabbage, avocado, or tomatoes really jazzes it up.\\n\\n* And pro-tip in case one does not know - never add salt to bean type foods till they are already soft...keeps them from absorbing water.\\n\\n[This is the recipe I use for Lentil soup](http://www.soupsong.com/rlentil7.html).   It's really yummy and works great as leftovers since it's easy to make a lot.  I add in chopped celery and carrots for extra noms.  Sometimes potatoes.\\n\\nBaking chicken is surprisingly simple too.  Just throw boneless skinless breasts into a dish with a little bit of chicken broth, spray them with olive oil and season with salt, pepper, onion powder - cover w foil &amp; cook at 350 for 40 minutes.  Take out, put oven on broil, put it back in till tops brown a bit &amp; voila!  Sometimes I do Italian seasonings for an extra kick.   \n",

Really. I don't think they own a salt shaker. Believe me, I've looked. Being served unsalted meat is just yucky.\\n\\nWe swap eating at each others houses. My food is always praised. My secret? SALT. Salt and white pepper (so the wife can't complain that it's 'too hot' because she sees pepper flakes without even tasting it).\\n\\nMy advice: do what you've been doing. And I use MSG in soups and stews all the time for a richer-tasting gravy.   \n",

If I'm not in a big rush, I'll use tamari, kombu, miso, fresh mushrooms, stock from dried shiitakes, reduced balsamic vinegar, red wine, tomatoes or tomato paste instead to add more flavour (and potentially nutrional content) as well. But I don't shy away from MSG as a last-minute addition or if I don't have time for all that.   \n",

I soaked the chicken in milk, lemon juice, msg, and salt before flouring. I put msg, salt, pepper, and granulated garlic in the flour, along with a little corn starch. From the soak into the flour, then egg wash then flour, fry at 350 degrees. I gotta say this is awesome.   \n",

Which are... MSG does produce a slight increase of compliments on the flavor. Due to the negative attention that MSG has received over the years, not sure why... I have hidden this fact, until recently... it was reveled, and to my surprise without any curt criticism.   \n",

A lot of people say to wipe or rinse the white powder off, but don't! That is where a lot of the flavor and good carbs are (or so [Alton Brown](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lld2TBlZDZg#t=7m05s) says). Not that there is anything wrong with MSG (besides a lot of misinformation), but this is just something different to try for that nice umami.    \n",

If I chopped up some fruit and tossed it with sugar, would you say that sugar artificially adds sweetness to the dish? That's basically how I see adding MSG to a beef broth or something of that sort.\\n\\n ____NEXT COMMENT____ \\nThe problem is that in studies (see Wikipedia) it's been shown that the symptoms are psychosomatic. Sounds like the blind taste tests you participated in were just that-- taste tests. MSG affects the flavor of dishes and can be easily identified by those that are used to looking for it. The useful study model involves consuming it via a pill or something else that bypasses the taste buds, then eating food.  \\n  \\nedit: Not saying you don't feel an effect, but just because you get migraines doesn't mean the MSG caused it.\\n\\n ____NEXT COMMENT____ \\nOK, if you say that you ate MSG, it passed over your taste buds and you swallowed it, and that flavor component was never detected, then there's nothing I can say.\\n\\n ____NEXT COMMENT____ \\nI was under the impression that manufacturers added things like yeast extracts for the sole purpose of sneaking MSG in the food. Why else would they put yeast in canned soup? Are you saying that it has a totally different effect?\\n\\n ____NEXT COMMENT____ \\nHow is MSG artificially adding that flavor? It basically defines umami. It's not really the same thing as artificial sweeteners tasting sweet-- MSG supplies compounds that have the exact flavor. Aside from having an MSG allergy, I see no reason not to use it if it's applicable.\\n\\n ____NEXT COMMENT____ \\nJust let us know if you ever take part in a double-blind study that uses pill/placebo MSG. That's all I have to say. Personally, if I thought I had an MSG reaction, I'd be thrilled at the idea that it could all be psychosomatic because who wants to have a reaction to anything, but I digress.\\n\\n ____NEXT COMMENT____ \\nPerception is more than just psychology. As others have said, eating salt or MSG affects the way your taste buds perceive other flavors on a chemical level, even if it doesn't alter the chemistry of the other food that is paired with it like a tomato.   \n",

We all agree it is retarded to avoid MSG. Nuff said.\\n\\n ____NEXT COMMENT____ \\nIt's not a by-product on soy sauce. It is extracted from wheat gluten proteins, at least nowadays. it was originally found in Seaweed, but now there are more efficient ways of producing it.\\n\\nAlso, to say it is 100% urban myth isn't entirely true. A few people do have a sensitivity to MSG, mostly of Chinese decent. It is no more common than a allergy though.\\n\\n ____NEXT COMMENT____ \\nSorry, I meant to add on that it can be a by-product, but it isn't necessarily only a by-product. I know tests have been done, but isn't there still a low amount of test subjects that did show reactions? I believe it was just concluded that the effects were not reproducible because of the extremely low percentage that was reported. Either way, it is ridiculous to stay away from MSG.\\n\\n ____NEXT COMMENT____ \\nOh yes, sorry I should have wrote that post better. I was not thinking in terms of soy-sauce, but MSG as an additive.

If you were actually allergic to it protein would kill you (or you die from not eating protein). \\n\\n ____NEXT COMMENT____ \\nI say go with MSG, after reading up on it, especially the chemical formula, I call bull on all that MSG is bad for you crap,  it is just a sodium salt of glutamate, in water (like your mouth or stomach) it breaks down to sodium and glutamic acid which is an amino acid, a basic building block of life, the Wikipedia puts it on the diagram next to lysine, the stuff people say you should eat more of.\\n\\nI have a hard time believing something so essential is going to be that bad for you, and any foods with meat in them have way more glutamuc acid in them than the MSG that you might add (tofu is 2% glutamic acid, steak is 5%), nobody puts that much MSG on their food.   \n",

It was phenomenal. We used Shocktop beer. In addition, I rubbed the turkey down with the following blend:\\n\\n1/2 teaspoon pepper\\n1/2 teaspoon garlic salt\\n1 teaspoon paprika\\n2 teaspoons Old Bay seasoning\\n4 teaspoons salt\\nA dash of MSG\\n3 tablespoons vegetable oil\\n\\nStuffed the inside with an onion and a lemon. Added baby carrots and fingerling potatoes and yellow onion to the roasting tray. \\n\\nWe brined the turkey for several hours in salt, pepper, and an assortment of herbs. Don't remember specifics, because it was my friend who supplied the turkey, but I think it involved basil, bay leaf, and a couple other herbs. Probably sage and thyme.\\n\\nAnyway, it was the absolute best turkey I have ever had.   \n",

Hmmmm...\\n\\nI'm not saying there aren't any people with legitimate problems, including the ones above. What I *am* saying is that 99% of the people who claim to have those ailments are hypochondriacs and/or attention whores.

It can start curing the meat.  And for anyone still afraid of MSG, just use some soy, worcestershire or fish sauce.\\n\\n ____NEXT COMMENT____ \\nYeah!  That's where I learned about that. And as for all those other suggestions I gave, they all have pretty strong flavors (and MSG for that matter), but I figure for anyone afraid of MSG itself, might as well go for something they're okay with.  I never use them for burgers, but figure someone else might find them useful.\\n\\nAnd if you can grind your own meat (food processor works, too, if you do it properly) it's wayyyy better!   \n",

( I don't know if it is a Hydrolyzed vegetable protein )...  Not speaking as an expert I would say that there is a very involved process isolating and extracting it may be difficult...\\n\\n\\nafter all...  Sugar, Citric Acid, and Aresenic are also naturally found in foods and vegetables, but they also take a pretty involved process to extract and purify them.\\n\\n ____NEXT COMMENT____ \\n[relevant](http://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/cynb5/ask_cookit_i_just_bought_some_msg_what_should_i/)\\n\\n ____NEXT COMMENT____ \\nMSG is kinda like salt, although not quite as good if you ask me...\\n\\nit is a natural flavor that we like and it tends to enhance the flavors of other foods...\\n\\nPersonally, I like to add it to foods that do not already contain the umami taste in nature...  stuff like raw / steamed veggies, salads, or salsa, and sauces...\\n\\nyou can also add it to dishes that need a little more of a 'meaty' full flavor  ( think boneless skinless ).... \\n\\nDO use it sparingly, a little bit goes a long way, and some people do have a somewhat negative reaction ( mostly headaches ) to the pure form of it when it is used as an additive...\\n\\nbut as far as flavor goes *MSG* is good stuff, is exists in food naturally, and has been used in cooking for ages.\\n\\ndon't listen to these people who are against it...  We don't just eat food because it is healthy for us, we eat it because it tasted good...\\n\\n\\n   \n",

It makes everything taste better. Besides, it is produced by fermentation (a natural process, mind you) unlike other crap which food manufacturers readily add into most of our food.    \n",

Best to go easy on it; real easy.  And to reduce added salt when using.  Further, if there are heavily fermented additions to the dish (soy sauce, Worcestershire sauce) it may be superfluous; both are already high in MSG.\\n\\n ____NEXT COMMENT____ \\nBasically it will enhance the perception of your basic foods.  DO NOT USE IN FRENCH COOKING.  But stews, sauces, rubs, etc....sure.  \\n\\nJust be wary of the salt content.  Salt + msg = tooooo much.  Always dial back the salt when using it. \\n\\n ____NEXT COMMENT____ \\nLightly.  Sub in 1/4 of the salt a recipe requires with msg... if that.  A little goes a long ways.  There aren't really adverse effects *per se* (monosodium glutamate is just an amino acid ionically bonded to a sodium) though some may exhibit allergy type reactions.  Honestly, I've put msg in food for years and never had any problems.  Note that in most asain foods msg doesn't really need to be added or do anything, there's plenty of glutamate in soy sauce, fish sauce, etc..\\n\\nJust don't forget that msg and sodium are nearly equivalents in terms of their sodium content.  Adding msg adds both the msg umami aspect *and* the sodium aspect. \\n\\n ____NEXT COMMENT____ \\n+ msg.  I know ppl will freak, but it works.  \\n\\n ____NEXT COMMENT____ \\nGinger, shallots, scallions.  MSG.  Tumeric, various marsalas, anise.\\n\\n ____NEXT COMMENT____ \\nIt *certainly* could.  I personally find making French sauces a bit daunting as it is.  As a scientist, I tend to recommend against using untested materials in a recipes that typically call for extremely exact volumes/measurements.  I really meant it as a rule of thumb, and frankly when I said it i was much more sober than I am now.  I would *love* to see recipes that took the best parts of the seasonings from around the world and used them to reinvigorate old recipes with easy, simple, tested, new science.  Offhan I'm not sure how much NaCl a hollandaise emulsion needs, but I don't for a second doubt that some of the extra chlorine in the mix could be replaced with glutamate to great and tasty!! effect.  (replacing a part of NaCl required w/ MSG).  Really, I don't want to accidently fuck up some sauce that someone has slaved over low heat for the last half hour making by tossing in an offhand recommendation to add msg to it.    \n",

They are probably the same people raising all the kids \"allergic\" to peanuts.   \n",
       "565  For breakfast, my favorite cheap, easy, healthy, tasty meal is \"spicy black beans and eggs on whole grain toast\". You can probably guess how it's made, but here's a recipe anyway: \\n\\n* Heat up a bit of olive oil in a pan, and stick your favorite brand of whole grain bread into the toaster. \\n* When the pan is hot, crack an egg into it. Scramble with a spatula until about halfway cooked\\n* Spoon a few dollops of canned black beans and a generous helping of hot sauce right on top. Continue to scramble until done, then scoop the entire mess on top of your toast.\\n\\nBy the way, a notable advantage of whole grain bread is that it has a much longer shelf life than white bread. I go one step further and get \"[double fiber whole wheat](http://www.naturesownbread.com/NAT_Varieties/Variety.cfm?CategoryID=100&amp;ProductID=16)\" which never goes bad. Ever.\\n\\nFried rice is ridiculously easy to make, and cheap to boot. The best part is that it takes advantage of leftover food. There are plenty of recipes out there, but here's a (relatively) short version: \\n\\n* Heat up canola oil in a pan, toss in whatever vegetables and/or meat you want in the rice. This can be leftovers you have from a previous meal, cheap frozen veggies, or those of the fresh variety. \\n* When this stuff is heated, add rice. Leftover rice that has been sitting in the refrigerator actually works better, but fresh rice is okay too. \\n* Stir everything until the rice is completely coated with oil, then push it to the side and crack an egg in the pan. Scramble that motherfucker and mix it with the rice.\\n* Toss in some soy sauce. You can add whatever other spices you think will taste good at this point - I like garlic powder, lemongrass, coriander seed, MSG, or whatever strikes my fancy at the time. Continue to stir everything until the brown from the soy sauce has spread out evenly over the rice, then turn the heat off and prepare to serve.\\n\\nStir-fry is even easier. All you really need to know is: Oil, meats and veggies, soy sauce, spices, maybe sesame oil, a stove, and a pan. Combine all those ingredients and stir. Serve with rice.\\n\\nWe all know that mercury is the sweetest of the heavy metals, and canned tuna is the best source of mercury on the consumer market. It's also cheap, nonperishable, easy to prepare, and otherwise healthy. The laziest option by far is tuna salad, which is a fine sandwich filler. This is just tuna, mayo, chopped celery, and whatever spices you think would taste good.\\n\\nAlso: Peanut butter. I think [this stuff](http://www.amazon.com/Smart-Balance-Natural-Peanut-16-Ounce/dp/B001M22TA4/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=grocery&amp;qid=1280168401&amp;sr=8-1) is really goddamn good tasting, and leagues healthier than Jif, Peter Pan, and the like. But whatever your choice, peanut butter goes on everything, from fruit to bread to crackers to a spoon. One of my favorite applications is the peanut butter, banana, and honey sandwich, which I will not insult you by providing a recipe for.\\n\\nSome other things to investigate that I won't go into because my interest in the subject is fading by the moment: Spaghetti, baked macaroni and cheese, tacos, bean dip, and chicken wings. Anyway, good luck!\\n\\n ____NEXT COMMENT____ \\n[[1]](http://jn.nutrition.org/cgi/content/full/130/4/1058S) [[2]](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6T6P-475T8XT-D&amp;_user=10&amp;_coverDate=12%2F31%2F1993&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=high&amp;_orig=search&amp;_sort=d&amp;_docanchor=&amp;view=c&amp;_acct=C000050221&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=10&amp;md5=22cfdd3b79b03ba2499facedde2fdd86) [[3]](http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/118565688/abstract?CRETRY=1&amp;SRETRY=0) [[4]](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6WPT-45FJY0F-1F&amp;_user=10&amp;_coverDate=10%2F31%2F1999&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=high&amp;_orig=search&amp;_sort=d&amp;_docanchor=&amp;view=c&amp;_acct=C000050221&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=10&amp;md5=a37c5433f41691138daa74b30f12dc9f)\\n\\nAnd for fun: [Natural MSG chart](http://www.swivel.com/charts/2478-MSG-content-in-food).\\n\\n ____NEXT COMMENT____ \\nThis really works. I never could quite tell what my fried rice was missing until my friend bought a bag of MSG.  Suddenly, my rice took on a familiar flavor.\\n\\nIf you're worried about health issues, do a little science reading. The health scare over MSG has been shown to be a result of poorly controlled studies - bad science.   \n",

It is a bunch of hooey. The flavor is flat untill the salt helps the palette engage the flavors. NOT to the point of saltiness, but salted to the point before you percieve it.  With the crusaders, it always turns out their favorite \"signature dish\" is something loaded with naturaly occuring salt, like bouliabaise filled with salty shellfish, or something with lots of parmesan or soy sauce.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Salt is the master of your food\" - Mohammed\\r\\n\\r\\nJesus refered to his followers as \"the salt of the earth\"\\r\\n\\r\\nGhandi led his people to procure their own salt.\\r\\n\\r\\nSALT is GOOD!\\r\\n\\r\\nTOO MUCH IS BAD!\\r\\n\\r\\nEDIT: cookbooks largely avoid or reccomend avoiding MSG because of the hysteria surrounding it. You don't want people freaking out and not using your cookbook or not eating at your restaurant because you use MSG. Thats what happened to many Chinese restaurants in the 70's.\\r\\n   \n",

Meanwhile, I would trip over empty 50 pound bags of the stuff out back by the dumpsters. Seriously. I know the stuff isn't this bad, but the first time you find yourself surrounded by those empty 50 lb sacks of it you kind of worry for a minute if you're going to be that one in a thousand that has some sensitivity.\\n\\n ____NEXT COMMENT____ \\nThere's a teensy percentage of the population who have a reaction to MSG and so now every fifth yuppie is sure they also have this problem. It's trendy to have a food intolerance and MSG is less embarrassing to go with than Celiac disease.\\n\\n ____NEXT COMMENT____ \\nI don't know what it is that makes people do this but it drives me crazy. One night on the internet and they have every disease on the webmd. \\n\\nIf you have a mild intolerance, you should probably cut back on the stuff that upsets your body. I get that. But people who decide they have a disease just because they read something that vaguely resembled their symptoms on a website do a terrible disservice to people-like you- who really have one, and are just annoying to everyone else. It's one of my pet peeves. I'll end the rant now because this is really getting off from my original comment, which was mostly that MSG comes in horrifically honking large bags. The fact that people who don't know they're eating it often have zero side effects from their 'MSG intolerance' was mostly just something I found dark humor in.   \n",

These are things that enhance flavor.  My Dad used to make the cheap hamburger taste really good by mixing it with onion soup mix.  I'd ask that you at least try it before you complain about contaminating your fancy beef, like you're Tony Danza or something.     \n",

I'm certainly not saying MSG is bad but if you or people you know are sensitive to this sort of thing I'd be curious if you have had any reactions to these things.\\n\\n ____NEXT COMMENT____ \\nBlack peppercorns - everything\\n\\nKosher salt - everything\\n\\n[Fried Chicken Seasoning](http://www.myspicesage.com/fried-chicken-seasoning-p-404.html?CAWELAID=405352115) - every type of poultry or potato\\n\\n[Chicken Base](http://www.amazon.com/Knorr-Chicken-flavored-broth-mix/dp/B007V47UBU/ref=sr_1_5?s=grocery&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1349791461&amp;sr=1-5&amp;keywords=knorr+chicken+base) - for veggies, stocks, sauces\\n\\nRosemary - many italian dishes, good woodsy flavor for poultry and potatoes\\n\\nGround Sage - Italian and middle eastern dishes\\n\\nSoy Sauce - Asian &amp; BBQ's\\n\\nGinger (ground, candied or fresh) - Asian &amp; BBQ's\\n\\nWhite distilled vinegar - Everything\\n\\nCumin - Mexican &amp; Middle Eastern\\n\\nRed Pepper flakes - Everything\\n\\nPaprika - Nearly everything\\n\\nCayenne pepper - Nearly everything\\n\\nA good dry white (Chardonnay) - Sauces and many italian &amp; chinese cooking\\n\\nGarlic - Everything\\n\\nOnion powder - Nearly everything\\n\\nBay leaves - BBQ's &amp; Stocks\\n\\nOregano - Italian\\n\\nCilantro - Mexican &amp; Chinese\\n\\nParsley - Nearly everything\\n\\nDill - Middle eastern\\n\\nMSG - Any meat\\n\\nWhite pepper - Asian\\n\\nLiquid smoke - BBQ\\n\\nDark Brown sugar - Nearly everything (to make light brown sugar: mix dark with regular sugar)\\n\\nI wanted to keep this list under 25 items but there are more and some people will use more or less of something depending on what food they like to eat.  Some things I feel I should tell you... fresh herbs have an extra something to them that I can't quite point out (maybe something to do with the liquid?) but dried herbs have a more intense flavor per volume.  If you can get \"smoked\" (spice) I usually like the flavor of them a bit more than (spice) regular but YMMV.  I tried to include what I use these spices/herbs for usually but don't let that limit you in what you can make.  Use whatever you like to make your food delicious, best of luck.   \n",

Adds a nice smoky flavor. JD works well. That + blue cheese = delicious.\\n\\nI mentioned the fried egg + cheddar + chives (breakfast burger) and fried egg + canadian bacon + salsa (cowboy burger) already.\\n\\nSomeone beat me to a \"pita burger\". Definitely use lamb, to answer your question.\\n\\nIf you want a veggie item, grilled(portabello + yellow/green squash + avocado) + cheese + greens wilted on top.\\n\\nA \"frenchie burger\" is a bbq burger with white cheddar, grilled french/chibatta bread toast on the side, covered in more bbq sauce. \"frenchie\" because it's open-faced, you eat it with a knife+fork, and it has the meat+sauce+starch of a traditional french dish. Variation: burger / toast / fries with peppercorn sauce and melted brie.\\n\\nA mustard burger. Mustard seed in the patty, glazed with mustard sauce, and served with stone-ground mustard (especially Sierra Nevada's IPA mustard) on top.\\n\\nMexiburger: chorizo + beef patty, pepperjack cheese, tomato. Served with either rice + corn, chips, or fried cheese instead of french fries. Make sure to have a spicy salsa on the side.\\n\\nUmami Burger: burger, portabello, MSG, sharp cheddar, and Worcestershire sauce. Serve without bun.\\n\\nOK, that's what I came up with off the top of my head. If you want to play around with different meats, check out bison meat, it's lean and gamey and makes a great burger, especially BBQ and/or with blue cheese.   \n",

This makes such a huge difference it must be repeated. Make your rice the day before and then fry it!*\\n\\n*The simple way I like doing it is: fry a ton of garlic in canola/vegetable oil, remove the garlic when crispy, fry the rice in the oil with a few vegetables (simplicity is sometimes best) and then add the fried garlic at the end. \\n\\nAnother little tip is to replace (some of) your salt with stock powder or cut out the middle man and just use good ol' MSG.    \n",

No statistical association has been demonstrated under controlled conditions, even in studies with people convinced that they are sensitive to it.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monosodium_glutamate#Health_concerns)\\n\\nHowever, it's certainly possible.\\n\\nEven if so, reacting poorly to MSG is like reacting poorly to peanuts because some people are deathly alergic. :shrug:   \n",

Yes. I'm serious.\\n\\n ____NEXT COMMENT____ \\nThe chicken flavour you get from maggi seasoning is a bit weird. Don't ask me why - it tastes nothing like noodle soups from my hometown. One of the best things there is this:\\r\\nhttp://rasamalaysia.com/ipoh-bean-sprout-chicken/\\r\\n\\r\\nYou could emulate the ingredients (minus whole chicken) for a quick version, add MSG if required.   \n",

Animal products tend to be the most rich in them (meat and cheese especially), though they're present in a lot of plants too -- MSG is a glutamate and is actually refined from a type of kelp. If you've ever had a good beef or chicken stock, that's the essence of umami.   \n",

It was coined in an article based on hearsay and anecdotal evidence, which happened to be published in the NEJM over 40 years ago. That is not the same thing as the journal endorsing its existence.\\n\\n\\n\"Blind taste tests\" aren't blind, because MSG has such a strong natural flavor. If you can taste it, you're not effectively blinded to it. The only way to do a blind trial of MSG sensitivity is to put it in capsules (with some capsules containing placebo). Was your trial conducted that way?\\n\\n\\nAlso, kombu is full of naturally derived MSG, so if you can eat foods containing kombu broth, then you're not sensitive to MSG. This \"cooking out\" thing has no basis in chemistry.\\n\\n ____NEXT COMMENT____ \\nIf you don't know the food has MSG in it, then how do you know MSG has caused your migraine?   \n",

I'm allergic to wheat so I have to scour the label of anything I buy to make sure I'll still be able to breathe when I'm done eating it. \\n\\nI'm willing to bet most people cook with MSG whether they consciously add it to their food or not. I eat far less processed food than the average person, because I'm allergic to most of it, and I still end up with MSG in quite a few of my meals. The bouillon powder I use has MSG in it, for instance. \\n\\nThe people giving you cold stares for adding MSG to your dishes and the people that claim that they get headaches from eating MSG -but only when they eat Chinese takeout- are being ignorant and hypocritical. Everything from canned soup to ranch salad dressing has MSG in it. Unless they prepare absolutely everything they eat, including condiments and seasonings, from scratch in their own kitchen they are eating MSG in most of their meals anyway.\\n   \n",

MSG is not an additive in traditional production of soy sauce, it is a byproduct.\\n\\nNobody has *ever* been able to reproduce a reaction to MSG in a double blind test. Including participants who have self proclaimed \"extreme sensitivities\".\\n\\n ____NEXT COMMENT____ \\nHahaha no MSG has no hassles like that - think of it as another kind of salt.\\n\\n ____NEXT COMMENT____ \\nMSG is not a preservative, and nobody had ever been able to prove an actual sensitivity to it in a double blind test.\\n\\nIf you are truly having a reaction to food rich with MSG, it isn't the MSG. It's something else (MSG rich foods do tend to be rich in sodium and fat as well). \\n\\n ____NEXT COMMENT____ \\nThe simple answer is that it's a savory flavor enhancer.\\n\\nIt doesn't have a particularly distinct flavor on its own (if you try it, it feels like it's about to taste like salt, but the saltiness never really kicks in). In combination with savory flavors it adds an incredible amount of body/depth to the overall flavor. It's ridiculous how much impact 1/2tsp of the stuff has in a giant pot of soup.\\n\\nPeople freak out about crystallized MSG, but if I threw half a tomato and 1/2tsp of salt into that same pot of soup, I just added the exact same amount of MSG.\\n\\n ____NEXT COMMENT____ \\nLots of foods have naturally occurring glutamates. Tomatoes, cheese, basically all meats, olives, etc. are good examples of foods that are rich in glutamates. Think of MSG as \"glutamate salt\". It's a glutamate bonded to sodium. As soon as it dissolves, the two break apart.\\n\\n ____NEXT COMMENT____ \\nThe \"umami\" flavor is the taste of free glutamates.\\n\\nThe easiest way to get it is to add MSG to your dish.\\n\\nAny braised meat dish will also release lots of free glutamates.\\n\\n ____NEXT COMMENT____ \\nThat sounds delicious!\\n\\nBut there is really nothing \"unnatural\" about MSG -- the hubbub about it was all a bunch of nuts making claims that couldn't be reproduced. MSG is naturally occurring in tons of food products, and even simply cooking meat releases glutamates, and seasoning it adds sodium.\\n\\n ____NEXT COMMENT____ \\nYes, MSG is a byproduct of producing soy sauce.\\n\\nIf you are trying to avoid all MSG you will also need to stop eating parmesan cheese, tomatoes, oysters, clams, mussels, seaweed, and many others. If you put salt on meat, you also have free sodium and free glutamates.\\n\\nMSG has no ill effects, and nobody has ever proven that they can detect or have reactions to MSG in a double blind test. It is 100% urban myth.   \n",

And yes, I'm pretentious.  I mean, I don't think I am, but everyone says I am, so maybe I am.\\n\\nWhat I'm trying to point out is, about 20 years ago I recall whenever anyone in Japan talked about \"umami\", they were talking about MSG.  Now it's this mystical fifth sense, which people like to attribute to different things.  I think we can all agree that there is a certain depth of flavor to things like fish sauce, shrimp paste, parmesan cheese, shiitake mushrooms, etc. but they might be better served by individual descriptors than just lumping it all into \"umami\".\\n\\n ____NEXT COMMENT____ \\nI hate to ruin the romance here, but I'm Japanese and \"umami\" is the flavor of MSG.  Discerning umami in Parmesan, bacon, mushrooms, etc. is just saying that those things remind you of MSG.  Americans started waxing poetic about the \"mysterious fifth taste -- umami\" and after a while even the Japanese started playing that up.\\n\\n ____NEXT COMMENT____ \\nsomebody (maybe that jeffrey steingarten guy?) said something along the lines of \"If MSG is so bad for you, why don't a billion Asians have headaches all the time?\"\\n\\n ____NEXT COMMENT____ \\nwell, they contain glutamates. still, the point is, \"umami\" sounds cool, \"this tastes like msg\" doesn't, especially since so many people claim to hate msg, or to get headaches from it.   \n",

That's why they're the first image on the wiki. :-P\\n\\nSavory/Umami is that thick, rich, coating meat taste that a rich broth gives you.  It covers your mouth in something that's beyond salty.  It's buttery, full.  It seems to tickle your tongue in a way that seems to PULL, direct you to eat.  Like it wants you to find more of the same.\\n\\nA really good way to tell the difference between salty and umami is to get a jar of MSG.  Lick your finger and take a little dab of salt (any will do, but Kosher/Sea taste best).  Taste it.  You'll get the same pull, but it'll be slightly acidic.  It'll pucker your face -- you'll do the \"WOW, THAT'S FUCKING SALTY!\" double-take.  Do the same with some MSG.  It'll remind you of a salted tomato.  Rich, sweet, salty, meaty.   \n",

I bought.. dried shitake mushrooms, black fungus (wood ear I guess), bamboo shoots, black vinegar, tofu, nice spring onions that are flowering (she said they have a great flavor and are not tough.. I hope she is right). The interesting thing was an \"instant hot and sour paste\" that has chili, kefir lime leaves, shrimp, soy oil, salt, garlic, and of course msg (which is very heavily used in many true ethnic cuisines)\\n\\nI think I'll end up using some chicken stock and pork.\\n\\n ____NEXT COMMENT____ \\nIf you have not tried it you should consider trying msg on your other foods. The reason those ingredients like mushrooms, tomato paste, anchovies and parmesan cheese are sources of umami is they are all naturally high sources of glutamate. It may really help with your condition post radiation treatment. Congratulations on being a cancer survivor!   \n",

For awhile, I made big batches of soup (with MSG) and I'd leave them in the fridge to have over a period of a week.  I only told him that it has MSG in it when he asked for the recipe after about a month of having bowls of it.\\n\\nHe doesn't mind MSG anymore.   \n",

The naturally occurring MSG in things like tomatoes or fish or everything else it occurs in is using MSG as a flavor enhancer. \\n\\n ____NEXT COMMENT____ \\n&gt;I am super sensitive to most preservatives (including MSG)...\\n\\n\\nWhat part of \"MSG is not a preservative\" are you struggling with?\\n\\n\\n&gt;\"sensative to most of the commonly used preservatives.\" \\n\\n\\nYou would be dead by now if that were actually the case. Still, I fail to see what any of this has to do with MSG. \\n\\n ____NEXT COMMENT____ \\nMSG exists naturally in tomatoes, along with other vegetables, mushrooms, seaweed, cheeses, and your own body.    \n",
