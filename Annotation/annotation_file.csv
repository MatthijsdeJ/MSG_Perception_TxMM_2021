76,"High levels of phytic acid in soy reduce assimilation of calcium, magnesium, copper, iron and zinc. Phytic acid in soy is not neutralized by ordinary preparation methods such as soaking, sprouting and long, slow cooking. High phytate diets have caused growth problems in children.

Trypsin inhibitors in soy interfere with protein digestion and may cause pancreatic disorders. In test animals soy containing trypsin inhibitors caused stunted growth.

Soy phytoestrogens disrupt endocrine function and have the potential to cause infertility and to promote breast cancer in adult women.

Soy phytoestrogens are potent antithyroid agents that cause hypothyroidism and may cause thyroid cancer. In infants, consumption of soy formula has been linked to autoimmune thyroid disease.

Vitamin B12 analogs in soy are not absorbed and actually increase the body's requirement for B12.

Soy foods increase the body's requirement for vitamin D.

Fragile proteins are denatured during high temperature processing to make soy protein isolate and textured vegetable protein.

Processing of soy protein results in the formation of toxic lysinoalanine and highly carcinogenic nitrosamines.

Free glutamic acid or MSG, a potent neurotoxin, is formed during soy food processing and additional amounts are added to many soy foods.

Soy foods contain high levels of aluminum which is toxic to the nervous system and the kidneys.

This is the Cajun/Creole seasoning recipe I settled on after playing around with a number of mixes. I like it because it's not overly dominated by paprika or herbs, while still being fairly complex. It's basically as hot as the amount of cayenne you add, but I use it in many things that aren't supposed to be especially hot (gumbo, red beans and rice, etc). The herb measures are for dried cut leaf; you can either whir it in a blade grinder after mixing if you need it to be shakable, or you can reduce the amount and use ground herbs.

&gt; **Creole Seasoning (personal mix)**

&gt; 1 T onion powder  
1 T Garlic powder  
1 tsp oregano  
1 tsp basil  
1 tsp thyme  
1 tsp ground black pepper  
1 tsp white pepper  
1 tsp cayanne   
1 tsp chili powder  
2 tsp paprika  
1/2 tsp ground celery seed  
1/2 tsp ground bay leaf

I find that a lot of the jerky recipes with soy sauce end up tasting the same. I've had a lot of luck with a light brine, cracked black pepper, a light smoke for flavor, and then finishing in a dehydrator or cracked low oven. 

**Jerky Brine**

2 Tb Kosher salt  
1 Tb Garlic salt  
1 tsp ground black pepper  
1 tsp cayanne  
1 tsp pink curing salt  
1 tsp MSG  
2 Tb brown sugar  
1 tsp Worsch. sauce  
4 cups water  

Brine at least a couple of hours (longer is better). Drain, pat dry, sprinkle with fresh cracked black pepper, smoke, then dehydrate.

You can get a recipe for basic miso soup anywhere. But generally speaking, you're going to get some wakame, miso paste, dashi mix (basically a mix of bonito flake, yeast, and MSG), silky tofu, and green onion. And even then, most of the soup is not really ""cooked."" You basically make the dashi, put in the miso/bloomed wakame/green onion/cubed silky tofu, let it get hot, and then it's immediately ready to serve. 

If you haven't worked with dried seaweed much before, just keep in mind that it balloons in size once briefly rested (5-10m?) in a mug or bowl of water. So even a couple tbsp dried wakame could make enough for a 5-6 quarts of soup.

586,"Don't cook with mushy rice.

Mix the rice up before putting it in the pan, so at best if clumped not clumped in balls more than an inch in diameter.

Have a really hot wok and really hot oil [1].

Don't stir, or at least stir very quickly.  Move/toss the rice around aggressively when adding it to the wok, keep the heat high, keep tossing.  After a minute the rice should be largely separated and starting to make popping sounds a bit like popcorn.  Bash those clumps so they break up.  Your arm should be getting tired.

Pour in 2/3 of your eggs.  Yes, don't pre-cook the eggs.  Keep things moving, the eggs should be all over the rice, you're not making an omelette.  You'll see the rice really separate now, the egg dries the mixture (keep the heat high).  The egg should have mixed with the rice forming very small pieces of cooked egg with the rice, nice and dry, moving around really smoothly.  Add in whatever leftovers you want to add like small chicken pieces.

Things should now be moving nicely with everything separated and no sticking.  Add your seasoning, I use chicken stock granules (eggs already seasoned with salt), these include some MSG.  Make a hole in the centre of the pan and add the remaining 1/3 of egg.  Give it 15 seconds, this is now your larger egg pieces, mix around, turn off heat, add some chopped green onions if feeling fancy.

The wok should still be making plenty of hissing sounds from the residual heat.  The rice will have that 'fried' taste you get in restaurants [2].

Plate and serve.

[1] I use a cheap carbon-steel pan that I've had for years, about 20 inch diameter, metal spatula, and cook on gas (really the only way to get enough heat for the method above).

[2] Better than most restaurants.

The idea is to stay away from things who's consequences we do not yet know.  While MSG may not cause immediate effects, it's pretty hard to tell whether or not its a carcinogen in the long term. Given that people eating traditional diets with low amounts of processed or ""unnatural"" foods have much, much lower incidences of cancer, diabetes, heart disease, etc than people who eat a ""western diet"" with lots of processed food and modern food additives, its a good bet there's something wrong with the ""western diet"".

That said how about a nice curry and rice?  It's easy, filling and can easily be vegetation friendly.  There are as many types of curry as there are people who make them.  Here is a super simple version that doesn't require much.  


You'll need:

Curry powder.  Available at many supermarkets.  S&amp;B brand is pretty good.  It comes in a small red and yellow can.  S&amp;B also makes curry roux but that's for sure a different recipe.

One onion cut into small slices

Two carrots

Bell pepper cut into bite size pieces

Two cloves garlic finely chopped

One slice of ginger finely chopped

Salt, pepper and msg (optional)

Half cup of vegetable stock

Half cup coconut milk or a quarter cup of cream.

One tsp of sugar
  
Heat up a pan or wok (better) until a drop of water floats on the surface without sizzling away. Add enough oil to cover the surface.  Toss in the veggies and stir fry until the onions sweat.    Add seasonings along with the garlic and ginger. When they become aromatic add one heaping tsp of curry powder and the sugar. Stir to coat.  Pour in the stock and coconut milk.  Continue to cook until the liquid reduces and thickens. Serve with rice.

You might try adding powdered broth (Knor/Maggi).  It packs a lot of flavor (and a lot of msg).   Also let your curry reduce a bit before judging its taste.

I didn't specify which type of vinegar, only that it contains it.  The difference in taste comes from the different types of vinegar used in all mayo (which in kewpie is usually apple and malt, I think) and how much, which is a bit more in kewpie (just based on taste, I would guess). Kewpie additionally ABSOLUTELY contains MSG, as well as being a more traditionally French-style mayo, in that it doesn't use whole pasteurized eggs in the emulsion, just the yolks. In my experience it's a bit tangier, a bit more savory, and quite a bit richer than the normal hellman's mayo.

Assuming you aren't able to follow the excellent home-made stock advice from tripnik, then getting a decent stock powder or liquid stock is your best bet.

Stock powders are easier, because they are cheaper, last longer, and you can add as much as you need.  They're much easier to work with than stock cubes that require crumbling, and always seem very messy.

I would recommend finding a stock powder with no artificial ingredients or MSG.  There are many varieties around, but if your local supermarket only has the cheap chemical stuff, then a health food shop or wholefood store would be your best bet.

Stock powder can also be used for a range of things:  you can use it as a meat rub when roasting or grilling, you can sprinkle it into the water while you cook vegetables, you can also add it to vegetetables once they're cooked.  Basically it's like a flavoursome alternative to salt.

I also recommend getting the lower-salt stock powders because you can always add more salt to anything.  But removing too much salt is pretty impossible.

 ____NEXT COMMENT____ 
I wrote this in a thread a week or two ago, apologies for just copying/pasting:

_______

First off, take a crystal or two, put it in your mouth and taste it. I know it might seem trite, but that's basically the flavor that you're adding to your dish - it's not really going to change through cooking.

The taste should be immediately recognizable. Why? It's used in like... a mountain of processed foods. Doritos are a famous example, but either MSG (or something like it) is in most powdered bouillon, KFC, Tony Chachere's Cajun Seasoning, etc.

This is how I personally use MSG:

1. *Use a little to bring out the natural umami in umami-rich ingredients.* If you taste fish sauce or soy sauce, the umami taste is pretty obvious. That's less true of, say, broccoli. [Take a look at this list](https://msgfacts.com/glutamate-in-food/) - if you're using any ingredient that has a free glutamate content over 100mg/100g as a primary ingredient, a small sprinkle of MSG can help bring out its natural flavor.

2. *Use it to balance spicy food.* Even those that love spicy food don't want just a raw Capsaicin taste from chilis. There's a bunch of was to balance that taste - sugar, acid, Sichuan peppercorns, etc. - MSG is one of them.

3. *Use in place of an umami-imparting ingredient like soy sauce.* Back in the 80s in China some families in the countryside couldn't afford soy sauce, and so some would turn to MSG instead.  Nowadays that's not really a problem, but sometimes you want a bit of umami but you don't want the color that soy sauce imparts. Alternatively, suppose you're using fish sauce but the quality you're working with ain't exactly Phu Quoc - a little MSG along with the low quality fish sauce can really work wonders.

Generally, MSG is added near the end of making a dish, as if it reaches temperatures above 150C it can start to degrade. Also, be sure you're not adding too much - for me, it's exceedingly rare to add more than 1/8 tsp to a dish - it's one of those things that if you can immediately notice it in the end product, you've been too aggressive with it.

For Western food, I generally add a bit to Chili con Carne and the cheese sauce for Mac N Cheese.

Another rule of thumb: whenever Kenji from SeriousEats adds fish sauce to a Western recipe which makes you pause and say 'hmm...', you can use MSG instead.  Same function, he's just looking to add a mild umami undertone.

 ____NEXT COMMENT____ 
Oh yeah, for sure! Actually either next week or the week after we're planning on sharing how to make a dish that I'm currently obsessed with: a Guizhou dish called Suancai (i.e. Pickled Cabbage) fried tangyuan.

What it is is black sesame tangyuan, deep fried, then stir fried with suancai, chilis, and MSG. It was weird as hell the first time I tried it (a relatively common reaction) - it's like... every single flavor all at once. But it's addictive as all hell, I order it from a local Guizhou restaurant around here like... weekly.

My workflow when I'm seasoning something:

1. *Salt.* If the dish tastes too plain.

2. *Sugar.* If the dish tastes unrounded - a little sugar mellows most tastes out.

3. *MSG, fish sauce, or good soy sauce.* If the dish's missing depth.

4. *Butter or lard.* If the dish is missing richness.

5. *Lemon/lime/vinegar/hot sauce.* If the dish needs some sharpness to brighten things up a bit.

 ____NEXT COMMENT____ 
I'll just toss this here... one of my favorites is Wawacai (娃娃菜, dunno the Cantonese). It's basically like a baby napa cabbage.

Here's the thing about napa cabbage, and in particular wawacai - it's actually one of the vegetables that's highest in glutamates. It's pretty great - my favorite way to prepare it is actually braised in (sort of) a Western style.

Cut the wawacai - separate out the mostly leafy portions with the rest. Fry some bacon to render out its oil, then fry an onion with that. Toss in the cut wawacai, season with some cracked black pepper. Then add in stock or water+stock concentrate, braise for a bit covered (15 min?), then a touch uncovered (til the liquid quantity looks about right), then season w/ salt, Worcestershire sauce, hot sauce, and a tiny sprinkle of MSG. Toss the leafy bits in, and once softened thicken it all up with a slurry.

 ____NEXT COMMENT____ 
Yeah it's sort of like the above comment chain on fish sauce. I'll ask myself, ""do I want the taste of fish sauce, or am I really just looking for the umami kick to round things out?"" 

If it's the latter, MSG.

Really balances the heat from chilis too. If you're making hot wings and really wanna push that upper end of the Scoville scale, MSG is a must to round out that raw capsaicin taste.

Of course, sometimes I'll also reach for the fish sauce, simply because fish sauce is tasty. Phu Quoc...

MSG is kinda like salt, although not quite as good if you ask me...

it is a natural flavor that we like and it tends to enhance the flavors of other foods...

Personally, I like to add it to foods that do not already contain the umami taste in nature...  stuff like raw / steamed veggies, salads, or salsa, and sauces...

you can also add it to dishes that need a little more of a 'meaty' full flavor  ( think boneless skinless ).... 

DO use it sparingly, a little bit goes a long way, and some people do have a somewhat negative reaction ( mostly headaches ) to the pure form of it when it is used as an additive...

but as far as flavor goes *MSG* is good stuff, is exists in food naturally, and has been used in cooking for ages.

This one is distracting, pretty easy, and rewarding. It's not authentic Italian but I'm south asian and we like to add extra spice  when we cook at home. 

1. Marinate shrimp in Cajun seasoning (you can look up how to make it or buy), extra paprika, and a store bought generic meat seasoning that has MSG and garlic in it. 

2. In butter, saute minced garlic and minced red onions. Add shrimp and parsley and maybe dried dill then cook through. Remove shrimp and set aside. 

3. Add vegetable oil, saute a good amount more of minced garlic and chopped onions. Add mushrooms and broccoli or green beans according to cook time. Season as soon as you add the vegetables with a lot of dried thyme, black pepper,  a little dried basil. Salt to taste. When it's done, add shrimp back in. 

4. Sauce is a mix of bechamel and normal Alfredo which doesn't get as greasy when you reheat it. Saute a little mince garlic in butter low heat. Make that into a roux and add milk. 

5. To bechamel add heavy cream and butter. When it's heated, add grated parm. Season with black pepper, cayenne, salt, and nutmeg. I add more cayenne to make it spicy. 

6. Add finished sauce into vegetables and shrimp. Adjust seasonings. Add a little more parsley, red chilli flakes, and a tsp of tomato paste. 

7. Add cooked pasta in with some of the water.

**Bengali Tomato Bortha, Alloo Bortha, and omelette with rice**
This is my laziest meal but it is really good comfort food to me. It's a Bengali meal but the only extra ingredients you would need are mustard seed oil and dried red chilles (crushed into powder). 

**Tomato Bortha**
It's basically tomato chutney or sauce. 

1. Roughly quarter 3 tomatoes. 

2. In small pot, add 2 tbsp water and put the tomato in. Cover and cook on low medium, then on low when the tomato break part more. It should be fully cooked and falling apart. 

3. Mash the tomato (when cooled), add thinly sliced red onion, chopped green chilli, 2 tsp mustard seed oil, and salt to taste. It needs more salt than you would think, just add slowly until you taste the salt over the acid. 

**Alloo Bortha**
Same process as above, but you do it with boiled and peeled potatos. Mash the potatoes then add the onions, chilis, mustard seed oil. This is where you can add red chilles too or just red chilli flakes. 

Last, make a [Bengali style omelette](https://youtu.be/O5SkZNkWhZg) and cook normal white rice.

Get a can of coconut milk, toss it in a saucepan. Add a generous squirt of ketchup, a few heaping tablespoons of peanut butter, and Sri Racha hot sauce to taste. Whisk together while heating, simmer for a bit. This makes a good base to which you can add all kinds of things--meat, veg, pour it over rice or noodle dishes, you name it. 

Also, the 5-minute miracle, yakiniku! My fiance got me on this one when he introduced me to Japanese cooking (he worked the kitchen in a Japanese restaurant for 3 years). Take a good cut of steak, and slice it into thin strips about 3 inches wide. Pour a few tablespoons of sesame oil into a stir-fry or saute pan and heat on medium-high. Make a teriyaki sauce: 1 part soy sauce, 1 part mirin (Japanese sweet rice seasoning sauce) or honey, whisked together. Add some minced garlic and fresh grated ginger to the teriyaki sauce (you'll want about 1 Tbsp per 6 oz. of meat, I think, maybe more). When the pan is hot, toss your steak pieces in, flip them a few times (by which I mean up in the air), then add the sauce and stir for about 1 minute. It really shouldn't take more than 2-3 minutes to cook the meat--you want it a little rare. Then pour the whole concoction into a bowl. You can serve it over rice or noodles, or just eat it up. 

We also like making ""sushi salad,"" which you will sometimes see as a brunch dish, apparently. For this you'll want a portion of sashimi-grade fish (we use salmon and tuna); it won't take much, about 3-4 oz. of each to serve two. You'll also want to get some sushi vegetables--carrots, cucumber and daikon radish are great--Japanese mayonnaise (it's got MSG in it; Kewpie brand is pretty good) and a little bit of hot sauce or wasabi. Cut the vegetables into long, thin strips and put them into your bowls. Slice the fish in thin strips and stick it on top (you can also sear it very lightly in a hot pan with sesame oil before slicing). Mix together a little mayo and hot sauce/wasabi to make spicy mayo.

189,"Wikipedia suggests that Italians use an oil made from olive oil and Calabrian chilis:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chili_oil#Italy

...I don't know exactly what sort of hot oil's expected for the Roberta's ""bee sting pizza"" you showed, but if I had to hazard a guess it would be that.

Honestly, I suspect that any sort of chili oil made from any chilis in any oil will work, if the intent is just to add a little heat (in addition to the hot soppresata.)

You can make your own chili oil by heating up some vegetable oil and then pouring it over dried chili flakes. I've been known to heat up cheap olive oil (a highly-processed one is best for this, not extra-virgin) and pour it over ""pizza pepper"" flakes to make it. (You have to use a sufficient quantity of chili flakes to keep the oil from incinerating them. Note that it may come out shockingly spicy -- after it cools down you can mix a little of the chili oil with plain oil to dilute it.) It's a common homemade Chinese condiment, so a Google search on ""chili oil"" will turn up many recipes and tutorial videos, some plain, and some with extra ingredients.

Here's a (rather different) store-bought Chinese hot oil topping I like on my pizzas:

http://nymag.com/strategist/article/lao-gan-ma-best-chili-sauce-review.html

https://www.amazon.com/Lao-Gan-Chili-Crisp-Sauce/dp/B0051D84JU

Stores that carry Chinese products should have it -- the brand name is ""Lao Gan Ma"" and the specific product is ""Spicy Chili Crisp"". It's relatively mild as chili oils go (I could eat it all by itself!) and it's loaded with crunchy things (such as black beans) and salt and MSG. It's a whole bunch of comfort-food flavors all at once. But it's probably not remotely like what Roberta's pizza uses.

* ""other"" (onion, garlic, turmeric, carrot flakes, etc.)

Nobody but me considers MSG a staple ingredient?

Were it socially acceptable, I'd buy a 55-gallon drum of it, dump it into a wading pool, and roll around in it.

So, it'd be one of my seven. 

And nobody's mentioning green vegetables! I will be the ruler of Earth when I am the only one who's not constipated. I'm going to steal all *your* ingredients while you're sitting on the toilet.

So, let's see... beef, tomatoes, onions, bread flour, lettuce, peas, MSG. (If I could have three more: chicken, cilantro, hot pepper.)

 ____NEXT COMMENT____ 
My go-to seasonings, some of which are guilty pleasures:

• dried onion flakes, dried carrot flakes, and dried celery flakes. These add flavor, color, and texture to things like soups and rice without having to chop up whole vegetables just to small quantities. Onion flakes can go right into anything (even sprinkled on top of dry things) but celery and carrot flakes have to be boiled to soften them up. 

• (echoing several other posters) smoked sweet paprika. Gives anything a mellow smoky taste. (For those times when liquid smoke would be too much.)

• Target's Salt-Free Southwest Chipotle Seasoning. It's a pretty standard onion-paprika-red-and-black-pepper spice mix, but I've never been able to hit that exact note with my homemade spice mixes.

• extra-virgin olive oil. There's a huge difference in flavor between kinds (and most that have crossed national borders have somehow become adulterated or otherwise substandard.) I use a cheap domestic one which tastes fine to me.  It goes into salad dressings, dipping sauces, etc. (and I even mix a little in when I make bread dough.)

• lemon, lime, or orange zest. Buy a small Microplane and zest your citrus before you peel or juice it. If you don't have an immediate use for the zest, you can easily dry it in the oven and save it in a little jar.

• Pink peppercorns. You'll probably need to mail-order them, and boy are they expensive (especially when you consider they're hollow and crush down to almost nothing when you grind them.) But they have an amazing magenta color and a delicate flavor that's kind of lemony, kind of flowery.

• Wild rice. It takes longer to cook (and a different amount of water) than does white rice, so I will occasionally cook some and keep it in the fridge. Then I can throw a little recooked wild rice into whatever rice dish I'm making -- it doesn't take much, since its flavor and texture is so distinctive.

The following four you'll need a Chinese supermarket for:

• Koon Chun Double Black Soy Sauce. This is a Chinese soy sauce with a sort of molasses added (it's not thick, it's just sweet.) You can of course simulate this with plain soy sauce plus brown sugar or molasses. 

• Chinkiang-style black vinegar (any brand.) A little of this mixed into some of the sweet soy sauce and you've got the basis of dumpling dipping sauce (add sesame oil, scallions, ginger juice, etc. to get fancy.)

• Lao Gan Ma Spicy Chili Crisp (a salty, chili-flakes-in-oil condiment from China.) I've made various kinds of chili oil at home but I can't quite duplicate the jarred stuff. It has loads of MSG plus a few crunchy fermented beans that give it a special umami zing.

• Plain old MSG powder. You can buy it in one-pound bags for a couple bucks at any Asian-themed grocery store, and that'll last you years (it never spoils.) If you've never tasted MSG crystals all by themselves, I recommend tasting it at least once in your life so you can say ""Oh, that's why Pringles taste like that!""

Congratulations! You've learned one of the great unwritten truths of flavor law.

I think of it this way: The basic chemical flavors we can sense with our tongue are salt, acid, sugar, bitterness, and umami (MSG), so getting two to five of those to balance out results in a complex flavor. So often when you've salted your food but it still seems like something's missing, a splash of something acidic (vinegar, lemon juice, tomato paste, etc.) will perk everything up.

The catch is that because acids are very reactive chemicals, they break down when heated in a mixture of other stuff, so you want to add the splash of ""finishing"" acid at the end of cooking. If leftovers are reheated, you may need to add some new ""finishing"" acid.

My personal favorite vinegar is Chinkiang-style black vinegar (from the Chinese grocery store), which is the one that's traditionally used to balance out the other flavors in hot &amp; sour soup.

I also use apple cider vinegar constantly (apples provide a different kind of tartness -- not just the acetic acid that's in every vinegar, but also malic acid which comes from apples.) I use cider vinegar for pickles, salad dressings, and so on, because of its sweet, fruity quality. (White wine vinegar and champagne vinegar are also great for those applications.)

Just stay away from the synthetic ""white vinegar"" (the clear stuff) sold at supermarkets. That's a photo developer, not a food -- it's edible but it's pure acetic acid, so it has a nasty, sharp, ""chemicaly"" flavor compared to the others which contain traces of whatever plants they were made from. (I used to develop three-foot-wide film, which involved working with gallons of acetic acid.

&gt; It's just salt and powdered flavoring.

One thing I like to show to people who are just learning the difference between junk food and home-cooked food: I mix salt, MSG, nutritional yeast, and a tiny pinch of garlic powder, and demonstrate that this is the flavor of any powdered ""chicken"" broth packet. If you do that demonstration the same day you're making real chicken broth, you can blow people's minds with the difference.

But it's okay to use MSG in sweet *meat* dishes. For instance, the sauce on Chinese-American lemon chicken (made from chicken broth and lemon juice, thickened with starch) often has MSG.

I have a small collection of them too. They're fascinating peeks into all these different subcultures from decades ago. They show just how rapidly food culture has changed in the USA (and how changes in the food culture reflect changes in society in general, and even political events.) I'm in my early 50s, so I'm just old enough to remember a lot of the weirdness from the '70s, such as all those pot-luck dinners where the people who didn't know how to cook *always* brought Jell-O ""salad"" with marshmallows and/or green beans in it. (Yes, just like in that first-season ""Simpsons"" episode.) And there was the obsession with pressure cookers in the '50s (and now it's back!), the Hawaiian food craze of the '50s and '60s (I remember when ""sweet &amp; sour"" changed from Hawaiian-style to Chinese-style), the fondue craze of the '70s, and... so... much... Carnation... evaporated... milk.

I'm particularly fond of the Chinese- and Japanese-inspired cookbooks from the '30s through the '50s, when most people in the USA knew nothing about Asian cuisines and you could see those dishes slowly becoming known, through a series of transitional forms designed to make it seem less foreign. (Remember La Choy ""brown gravy""? And those canned fried noodles? In the early days, tofu was ""soybean cheese"", soy sauce was ""Chinese sauce"", and MSG was ""gourmet powder"".)

Speaking of MSG, I even have a cookbook published by a respectable culinary-education institution but sponsored by an MSG manufacturer... literally every recipe has MSG substituted for the salt. You can't get more Mid-Century American than that.

Those old cookbooks are like a trip in a time machine. You step into the machine thinking, ""Cool, I'm going to meet my heroes!"" and five minutes after you arrive, you realize, ""Wow, people were *gross* back then.""

Sometime around the year 2100, space archaeologists will use their space shovels to space-unearth the shattered ruins of Pinterest and conclude that people in 2019 were just as naïve.

It's good in a lot of things that involve wet meat (soups, stews, even pasta sauce if you go easy on it) but I did one failed experiment:

"" Ok, for the sake of clarity, in case some redditors come fronting with their supposed cooking talents, but are in fact only home cook housewives hidden within a bacon smell in order to lure you: I grew up in restaurant business. My father had three restaurants in France. One of them visited by a French president himself. Our restaurant was facing the Louvre and got free advertising on French national radio because it was that good. Later on, I opened a restaurant with a friend in studio city in Los Angeles that made the Zagat twice. One time, in 2000, “best personal restaurant in Los Angeles”, and in 2001, they called us “top notch”. The present governor of California came on a weekly basis and may other folks. Our setting was intimate. Our cuisine was magnificent. The product we served was hand picked at three in the morning. We snatched the goods from big restaurant names because their chefs were too lazy to do the trip to the early morning markets. Mexicans filet makers loved us. Fresh vegetables kept their best in their backrooms for us. We ruled LA for three years and sold the darn joint in time before the economic collapse. Because I love reddit, once a week I will give you one of our recipe. Fuck you if you want to hate, enjoy if you find these recipe attractive. These recipe will need passion and work. Not for the faint of heart. Oh, also, my grammar sucks, because English is my second language. So for those grammar Nazi, please go suck a dick. Here's my first recipe for you my dear reddit:

Spaghetti alla Bolognese

The secret of all good French and Italian sauce –and why you guys get heart burns all the time in the US – is a good stock. In the US, most restaurant is fucking you by doing cheap beef stock you wouldn't want to see how it is made, so there is may stock:

Veal stock:

Get three big bones of veal. I don't care how you find the darn thing. Kill it yourself for all I care, just get some darn veal bones. Pick a large Aluminum or stainless steal bowl. Put the bone in it with marrow showing. Usually neck bones are the best. Add a pinch of rock salt, two tablespoons of your best olive oil, black pepper grounded coarsely and fresh thyme. Don't even read further if the thyme is not fresh. Just don't . Forget it. Oh, you have fresh thyme? OK. You can go on. Now get some real garlic. Not that “made in China” shit that composed 90% of what in your supermarket (I'm not shitting you, 90% of the garlic you find in your store are now made in China. Half of it grown with human waste. You can send a nice thank you letter to the FDA if you wish). OK, now you have the right fucking garlic. Cut it nicely like uncle Pauli, meaning super thin. Cut 4 buds. Toss it in the bowl with everything I said earlier. Watch your fucking hands like you are going to operate someone. Done? OK. Now mix the whole thing in the bowl with your hand.

Now set the oven like it is hell inside, 450 F, no less. Put the content of the bowl in a cast Iron pot with no enamel, like cowboy style. Put it in the oven. Cook 35 minutes. The house should smell like an Italian girl comes in your house and suddenly want to have sex.

You should stay on this so don't do anything else until those bones are done.

OK, now. Peel 4 large carrots, some gorgeous stuffs. Not the stuff you buy with food stamps. Two nice leeks. Yeah, the cashier will ask you what the hell this is, guaranteed, and you'll tell her, “you know, there is more than chicken and beef out there!”... anyway... cut the leeks along the length and clean it thoroughly (sand love to stick on those). Two branches of celery only. Two large white onions, the kind to make a grown man cry. Cut them only in half. Half a cup of tomato paste. (the ingredients should read: “Tomatoes”, and nothing else, no salt, no sugar, nothing else. Those are out there, I get them all the time even in the shittiest store; just learn how to read. Usually they have Italian name. Just don't do Heinz). Six whole pepper seeds, two cloves. A huge bunch of curly parsley, half a lemon with its skin, half a pound of Crimini/ Italian brown mushrooms. Fresh fucking thyme, a lot. Put all this in two gallons of water in a very large pot. Toss the bone inside with a good piece of smoke pork belly or a nice piece of bacon (but not too big as to overpower the veal. Remember, it's a veal stock, not a pork stock, ok?). Mix a bit. Boil for a hour. Simmer for four hours. Kill the fire. Keep the liquid. Throw everything else. Yes. Do it. Those vegetables and meats have given to the liquids everything they had, their taste, their soul, everything; even if they still look good, they are pointless to eat. Now your veal stock is ready. You can save it for two weeks. Beef stock can be saved a mere four days. Fish stock only two days. Chicken stock three days top. I know this well: these are the regulations that if you break them causes the state inspectors to close your joint!

All right. Now you have your stock that took you a whole fucking Saturday to do, and you are ready to have that Italian chick on Sunday for a great Bolognese and even better sex.

Start with one nice big onion cut in small cubes in grape seed oil. Not olive oil. Grape seed oil is also an Italian (and French) thing. It has not cholesterol, no polyunsaturated fats, and has no taste. So all the ingredients you cook stays genuine in flavor. It's a bit pricey but it kept on going until 400F before burning. In other words, that oil is from the Gods, and the US corporate food hates it and never uses it. So it must be good.. Meanwhile, crush four canned anchovies in a small bowl. I know you American won't like it, but I promise you: you will never feel nor taste it, it's just like a natural MSG that, if you don't tell anyone, no one will notice, but it does make a hell of a difference in the deepness of the overall taste. Now saute the onion in a large, I mean large a pan, 12 inch minimum. The largest the pan is, the more the water can evaporate and the brown crisp can develop beautifully everywhere.

Half way until brown put the anchovies with the onion and mix... yes...i know... it will smell horrendous in the first minute.. like some bad smelly socks.. full of ammonia.. ... yes... I know.... but then things starts to transform and the smell becomes amazing... well, maybe you'll find out after a dozen try, anyway. Now, put your grounded beef, grounded veal and grounded pork, equal parts. For 4 persons? Try half a pound of each. If you can't find ground veal, do half beef half pork. That's all right. You will just miss on something extraordinary, but you can keep on reading. Anyway, now the fishy smell should be gone. Toss in it one full garlic clove minced. Mix well on full fire. Add one full tablespoon of salt, same with black pepper.

When all the meat seems cooked and the proteins starts developing into an inconvenient crust at the bottom it is time for the wine to come singing. Red. Dry! One full cup to start. OK... I forgot something... Have this cup of wine hot on the side. You don't want to stop the cooking process by pouring cold wine on the meat! So heat up the wine just 4~5 minutes before doing this. Now pour the how wine on the meat and toss a pinch of coriander in it. The latter kills the taste of alcohol and leaves the warm taste of the wine intact. Whatever... just, put a pinch of the darn thing. Deglaize. Now the wine is almost absorbed, add a full cup of veal stock. Cover. Cook for 30 minutes.

Open it up. Now it is smelling like fucking heaven and the Italian girl is really all over you. Hold her up by pouring more wine in her glass and come back to the stove. Put your dick on your hear, you'll smoke it later. Now, open a big can of magnificent crush tomatoes and toss it in the sauce. You don't need to add more tomato paste (hey, the sauce does not need to be this fucking “red” like corporate food wants you to believe. Taste it, you'll understand) Mix well. Add a nice bunch of big basil leaves in it. If you want to add great quality mushrooms, or some oil infused with it, here's the time. Cover again. Add a cube of unsalted butter. Don't ask why. Cook 20 minutes more on low fire.

Kill the whole thing. Keep it covered. Cooked your spaghetti the heck you want it to be done. Toss with the sauce in a way the pasta does not swim in it, with fresh grated dry Italian cheese on top. Cut some parley thin and reserve for the final touch on the plate on top of the cheese. Serve with a burgundy or a top notch Californian Pinot noir, and Crispy Italian bread. Have the girl feeding you.""

Won Tons: Pork mince and add finely chopped ginger, garlic, shallots, salt, white pepper and sesame oil. Mix. Stuff into wonton wrappers. Make heaps and keep them in the freezer for future won ton soups.

Prawn/Shrimp Won Ton filling: minced shrimp/prawn meat, ginger, light soy, sesame oil, white pepper and a couple of pinches of cornflour to make it sticky so the wontons hold together. Same deal as the pork wontons. Stuff. Cook. I don't think these freeze as well as pork ones.

Cheats Broth: Use chicken broth powder bought from an Asian grocer. It's 100% salt and an extra 10% MSG. It's not great, but it's fast.

Proper broth: You can use a slow cooker to make chicken broth. Take chicken carcasses/wings/whole chicken/watever, cover with water, add ginger, garlic, onion, maybe carrot, whole peppercorns and leave it slow cook all day. When you come home, remove the solids then season with soy sauce. Bam. Broth. Use the slow cooked chicken meat in your wonton soup. You can do the same by simmering the ingredients for hours in a big pot.

Assembly: Boil the broth in a pot, cook the noodles then remove to a bowl, cook the wontons then remove to the bowl, quickly cook any veges in the broth (30 seconds) then place in the bowl. Pour the remaining broth over your wonton soup. Top with chilli oil.

Don't have chilli oil? Take a bunch of dried chilli flakes, cover with peanut oil or another neutral oil (grapeseed oil is awesome). Leave at room temp until the oil is nice and red then refrigerate.

Vietnamese Pho remix: Do the same for the broth but use beef bones and add coriander. You'll need to skim the scum on the top though.

Thai remix: Add lemongrass and coriander to the broth. Coriander and chilli to the wontons. Squeeze lime in at the end.",

All of this is to taste and desired portion, so tear that shit up, spray lightly with olive oil, and season.  I would suggest proportioning the seasonings MSG&gt;Salt&gt;Black pepper.  One squeezed key lime is usually enough for a single serving, but experiment.

Anything extra like purple cabbage, avocado, or tomatoes really jazzes it up.

640,"I am Taiwanese and grew up in a heavily Asian city/region of Southern California, but I live in a place that lacks both quality and quantity in terms of Asian food. I make it a personal mission when visiting home to drop by a Ranch 99 or similar Chinese/Asian market (the Japanese chain in Southern California is called Mitsuwa, and it's a pretty large one) and stock up on what I like to call Apocalyptic Soup Reserves. My usual haul looks something like this:

* 1-2 2.5oz bottles of Hon-dashi granulated fish stock (Ajinomoto brand) - this is prepared from bonito and is not something you want if you believe MSG is bad for you. I love MSG so there you go. This shit is essential in my drunk-must-have-something-in-10-minutes cookery. It's basically instant soup stock and also acts as seasoning (salt).
* 1 20oz bottle of soy paste (usually Kimlan), either regular or spicy. This is exactly what it sounds like: a thick soy sauce with the consistency of... BBQ sauce? It has a slight sweetness and not nearly as much salinity as regular soy. It adds color and obviously salt to soup stock.
* 1 12oz container of fermented chili bean paste. I have no idea what brand to recommend except to say they are all pretty good. This is to add depth and heat to a soup stock. It's pretty good as a condiment for anything, really. Alternatively, you can get the stuff that looks like satanic red orange oil with a bunch of chili flakes swirling around in it. It's a popular table side condiment at Chinese restaurants.
* 2-3 12oz containers of chili bamboo shoots. These are pickled bamboo shoots sitting in chili sesame oil. The shoots are delicious, but the oil is also very much usable for anything.
* 1-2 8oz containers of zha cai, or Chinese pickles. They are frigging delicious and are the traditional condiment for my favorite meal in the world: Taiwanese beef noodle soup. (I make it probably once every three months. It's not that hard, I just don't have much fridge or freezer space). Any pickle is a good choice but these are my favorite.
* 3-6 packages of frozen dumplings, the cheaper the better because frankly I have yet to encounter any that are bad, just some that are pretty good. These will seriously cost you maybe $5 for a package of like 30-40 dumplings if you look for the stuff that's on sale. I prefer the simple pork and leek ones myself. These are wonderfully cheap and easy substitutes for buying/preparing protein yourself, and obviously they keep well. Just make sure to chill during your drive home because once slightly defrosted they have a tendency to stick to each other.
*White pepper. So simple, and so essential for me.
*Rice wine vinegar. Seasoned or not, not really too big of a difference for this purpose.
* 2-3 3-6lbs packages of dry noodles, preferably medium width. (Just my opinion.) This is the most important part, but also the part I change the most if that makes sense. Basically any good Asian market will have a huge selection of noodles. They will be branded in their chosen language (everyone makes good noodles so don't be afraid to try Korean or Vietnamese or whatever), and it'll probably be pretty confusing. I try as many different brands and makes as possible simply because they are so very cheap. A single 5lb package of noodles is probably about $6-$8. Right now I have been buying a lot of Well Luck products and they are treating me right. Here's a [catalog](http://s230968237.onlinehome.us/product.php?id=13&amp;b=on&amp;page=5) (I've been getting the Gourmet Master brand). You can certainly get ""fresh"" noodles in wet packs (like udon), but dry noodles are so very stackable and really almost impervious to any kind of fucking up.

OK, so that may seem like a lot but if you seriously eat it twice a day everyday the above haul should probably last you at least a month if not two or three, depending on noodle portion size. And the above should cost somewhere in the realm of $35-$50. In no way did I actually perform any rigorous math here so don't hold me to it.

So basically you now have a larder of Asian noodle soup ingredients that won't take up much room and can be made in whatever amount of time it takes to boil water plus 5-8 minutes for the noodles/dumplings. The above are my basics, but obviously you can include things like pickled ginger, nori (seaweed sheets), dried shrimp or scallop (they are edible but mainly there for flavor), fish cake (a delicious Japanese concoction found in ramen and made from burdock, usually), etc. Aaaand here we go:

1. Think about how simple or complex you want it. If you want greens, just remember to buy some spinach/scallions/napa cabbage/whatever works in a soup and have it in your fridge. If you want added flavor depth, keep some garlic and ginger around. (When I am drunk I do not have the patience to peel garlic and ginger, so I sometimes just smash the shit out of it and toss it in the water I've reserved for the soup and then strain.) Nothing beats a stock made from meaty pork bones, kombu and tare, strained and then even clarified, but obviously this thread is not about that. If you have stock around, awesome. Not entirely necessary though. Basically having a few bits of produce can really help out a meal from an aesthetic and nutritional viewpoint. I personally dig on bean sprouts and cilantro. I will often buy pork or beef and roast it to about rare or mid-rare, let it sit and then off to the fridge. When ready just slice and add in and watch til your doneness is approached. Any protein works, but for convenience I like to par cook so I'm not dealing with multiple pans every day.
2. Eggs. Have them. Drop them into the soup pot and depending on how you like them you will either have a soft poached delight or if you thought ahead hard boiled awesomeness. The whites will add body to a soup naturally and a soft yolk is nature's most perfect sauce.
3. Keep your soup pot and noodle pot separate. Unless you know your noodle timing and/or want increased starch presence in the soup. Some days I like clear broth, and some days I don't. I also tend to salt my boiling noodle water heavily. If you're like me and you don't have a huge pot at home then the water will boil over; keeping soup and noodles separate during the cooking is a good way of avoiding soup loss from boiling over or absorption during cooking. 
4. Invest in a big bowl. One that is capable of holding at least 3-4 cups (24-32 liquid oz.) is a nice idea. Also get some Asian soup spoons and of course chopsticks, unless you don't like chopsticks. Asian supermarkets have all of this for staggeringly low prices.
5. When in doubt, test a noodle every 30 seconds after four-five minutes at full boil. There is a sweet spot but I think for a lot of Asians it's just a little past al dente. Not toothy, but firm.

OK, now on to the actual process.

1. Run that tap. Hot tap water equals less time waiting for a boil.
2. Get two pots on, one for the noodles and one for the soup. Salt the noodle water. (Don't be gentle, but don't dump half a cup in there either.) Add whatever amount of soup water you'd like, plus maybe 2oz more to accommodate loss.
3. If you have garlic, ginger, onion or anything that takes a bit of time to cook put that in the soup pot first. (Obviously the smaller the cut the faster the cook.) Any greenery like spinach or scallions that takes little time can be added last, or even into the bowl directly. (This applies to any herb used. Don't add cilantro, basil etc. until ready to eat.)
4. Start making that soup. If you have veg/chicken/pork/etc. stock obviously you'd use that either in replacement of or in conjunction with water. Add the hon-dashi. It's just like salt in terms of amount. It will give the water a slightly beige color. Add soy paste or soy sauce if using. Add whatever amount of spice from fermented chili soy bean or similar flavoring. Add a dash or two of vinegar or an acid. It brightens up the soup and makes something that would normally be just salty into something better. You should never boil a broth/stock, so once you get there reduce heat and let it simmer. Adjust seasoning to your tastes. If too salty either add water or, if you're lucky enough to have it on hand, a peeled potato. 
5. Add noodles to boiling water. If using dumplings, I find it's easiest to put them into the soup pot because you don't know if the noodle and dumpling cooking time will sync. Frozen dumplings are done when they've been floating for a few minutes. Test one if unsure.
6. After about 5-8 minutes noodles should be done. Put a colander in the sink. Increase heat on the soup pan and add eggs/additional greens/par cooked meat. When done, strain the noodles. Put strained noodles into your bowl. Stand back and admire.
7. Splash noodles with either oil or some of the soup so they don't stick to each other.
8. When the stuff in the soup pot is done to your liking dump the contents into the bowl and onto the noodles. (Be careful with medium and soft eggs.) By now you will have some understanding of whether you made the ""right"" ratio of noodles to soup. I like a heaping pile of noodles with just enough soup to barely not cover. You may be different.
9. Garnish with herbs, pickled stuff, etc. If you have/like sriracha/hoisin, go to town.
10. Have intercourse with your food. Because that's what it'll look like to everyone else.

If done right this should take about 10-15 minutes, and you'll really only have to clean two pots, one knife and a cutting board. And of course your bowl and utensils. I have also omitted everything else except water, hon-dashi, soy sauce and noodles and, while not the most elegant of meals it did get me through the night. Taking a few extra steps to have the above will make a difference, though.

(If OP does not have any Asian markets nearby, sorry.)",
718,"Indeed helps many dishes.  Best to go easy on it; real easy.  And to reduce added salt when using.  Further, if there are heavily fermented additions to the dish (soy sauce, Worcestershire sauce) it may be superfluous; both are already high in MSG.

Basically it will enhance the perception of your basic foods.  DO NOT USE IN FRENCH COOKING.  But stews, sauces, rubs, etc....sure.  

Just be wary of the salt content.  Salt + msg = tooooo much.  Always dial back the salt when using it.

Lightly.  Sub in 1/4 of the salt a recipe requires with msg... if that.  A little goes a long ways.  There aren't really adverse effects *per se* (monosodium glutamate is just an amino acid ionically bonded to a sodium) though some may exhibit allergy type reactions.  Honestly, I've put msg in food for years and never had any problems.  Note that in most asain foods msg doesn't really need to be added or do anything, there's plenty of glutamate in soy sauce, fish sauce, etc..

Just don't forget that msg and sodium are nearly equivalents in terms of their sodium content.  Adding msg adds both the msg umami aspect *and* the sodium aspect.

It *certainly* could.  I personally find making French sauces a bit daunting as it is.  As a scientist, I tend to recommend against using untested materials in a recipes that typically call for extremely exact volumes/measurements.  I really meant it as a rule of thumb, and frankly when I said it i was much more sober than I am now.  I would *love* to see recipes that took the best parts of the seasonings from around the world and used them to reinvigorate old recipes with easy, simple, tested, new science.  Offhan I'm not sure how much NaCl a hollandaise emulsion needs, but I don't for a second doubt that some of the extra chlorine in the mix could be replaced with glutamate to great and tasty!! effect.  (replacing a part of NaCl required w/ MSG).  Really, I don't want to accidently fuck up some sauce that someone has slaved over low heat for the last half hour making by tossing in an offhand recommendation to add msg to it. ",
274,"When I make tomato sauce, I don't usually add meat.  I'll add meat when I'm making the dish later.  What I do is:

A few cans of San Marzano toms, whole, then mushed up by hand in a big bowl (very satisfying to do)

Cook up some garlic and onion in the pot.  Sweat it like a hot yoga class

Add some very thinly sliced carrot, let it start to soften.  

Deglaze with a bit of red wine

Add toms and bring to a mild simmer

Turn heat down and ride that train for the next 4-5 hours, stirring every 15-30 minutes.  The carrots will disappear if you cut them small enough, but lend a lot of sweetness to the sauce.  

For spices, I tend to add a bit of red pepper flake, rosemary, oregano, and basil.  Fresh, if you can.  

The next big secret apart from carrots that I tell people is *fish sauce*.  You may not be into that depending on how you feel about fish.  But traditionally they would add anchovies and cook them into the sauce - this is replacing that.  It adds some amazing umami-ness and brings out the glutamates in the tomato.  If you really don't want to add fish, I would suggest chopping up some mushroom and adding it with the carrots.  Mushrooms also have a lot of glutamates. And maybe toss a bit of MSG in.  

When I serve, I'll cook up some italian sausage with more onion, bell pepper, mushroom, maybe spinach, and fresh grape tomatoes.  Add the sauce and simmer it all together and serve over pasta.  

Just some ideas for how to do the sauce a bit differently.",

199,"Tamari (gluten free soy sauce)
Fish sauce (make sure its gluten free)
Get some gluten free flour and make a roux using that. Use a gf flour blend rather than just cornflour or potato flour, it gives more flavor. You can make a brown or blonde roux with GF flour too, just make sure to not use self raising.
Add more vegetables.
Add tomato paste.
Cook the vegetables longer, perhaps by roasting them instead to add layers of flavor.
Gluten free stock cubes. 
Make your own beef stock! You can just sub flour with gf flour.

Dark brown sugar instead of white sugar.
Dairy free butter.
Monosodium glutamate; if you normally use curry mixture that is prepackaged it might contain msg.

A few final tips for cooking gluten free:
Beware of cross contamination.
If you have eaten something containing gluten, be extra careful not to lick any implements and dip it back into the food.
Clean the chopping boards and surfaces thoroughly before use. Gluten is sticky and gets everywhere.
Always check the packaging.

No worries.  Metabolism (especially at the multicellular level) is extremely complicated. I'm glad that I could give you some better information.

713,"I make stew once a week in winter and my method is full-proof for great results.  It's not really novice level but not difficult either, just a little more involved (worth it to me).

I dredge my meat (usually use beef short rib or chuck) in flour and brown it in olive oil in my dutch oven.  Brown on all sides.  Remove from pan and set aside.  Do in batches if you are making a lot and/or pan is small.

Add diced onion, garlic, and celery to pan (you shouldn't have to add any more fat, but can if you need it) and saute a few minutes until onions start to go transparent.
 
Then add 2 Tbsp of tomato paste and stir and cook on medium heat until paste has turned dark and is sizzling on bottom of pan. It should be evenly spread out amongst all the veg. This step is very important and can't be skipped.

Then add stock and wine to the pot to create enough liquid to come up 1/2 way on your meat when it's added back in, say about 3 cups total.

At this point I'll add seasonings (for me, Mrs Dash, pepper, a little MSG, and a little cinnamon), stir it in.  A bay leaf would be good too. Unfortunately I can't add any salt.

Then add meat back in, turn heat to low, partially cover pan, and cook for 90 minutes or so.  This part can be done in the oven if you want, but I always use the stove.

After cooling a bit off heat, I take out the meat and either puree the sauce (with an immersion blender) or run it thru a sieve.  I like smooth sauces (the onions etc have given up their flavor to the sauce, what's left is dross in my opinion). I realize this part is more fuss than most people want to do, but the end result is cookbook-picture-worthy in appearance.

At this point I almost always stop and refigerate the sauce and meat separately overnight and finish (and eat) the stew the next day. The braise-cool-reheat cycle makes meat very tender.

The next day I'll return the sauce (which should be very thick almost jelly like) to a pot on medium heat, add whatever veg I want (carrots always, sometimes parsnip, zucchini in the summer, potato if I'm not doing them separate as mashed, whole mushrooms) and cook for an hour or so until the veg is tender but not mushy.  Obviously add delicate veg (eg zucchini, mushroom) towards the end. Also add the meat back in with 20-25 minutes to go and get it down in the juice.  I also add some chopped parsley at same time as meat. (Add more stock/water if you feel there is not enough sauce, especially if you're going the mashed potato route).

That's it.  If I didn't put potatoes in the stew, I'll serve it with mashed potatoes.  The sauce makes a great gravy.

I like splitting it up into 2 parts. Again the cool and reheat really does a number on the meat, it allows the proteins to relax.",

Quiche is one of those things you can kind of just make with whatever's in the cupboard, but this is a common recipe I use:

Caramelise 2-3 small to medium onions, adding garlic and maybe shallots when they're 3/4 caramelized. Deglaze with water until the final deglaze, then use balsamic vinegar.

While that's going, break 10-12 large eggs in a bowl, and set aside in fridge. Coarsely grate 1.5-2 cups of sharp cheddar, and 50ish grams of parmasianno regiano. Crumble 25-50 grams of blue cheese and cube 50-100 grams goat feta in the bottom of a pie plate.

When the onions are caramelized (this takes no less than 45 minutes) drape them over the cheese.

Grind fresh pepper onto the eggs. No, more, that's not enough. Keep grinding. Add about 1/4-1/2 teaspoon salt and MSG, to taste. Beat eggs well, then mix in the cheddar and half the Parma. Pour eggs and cheese  into the pan and cover other ingredients well. Sprinkle remaining Parma on top, and bake at 350 for 45-60 minutes or until the top is golden brown and a toothpick comes out clean (I just do it by eye).

I'll often throw whatever leftover meat and veggies I have laying around, but be careful not to add too much moisture with the veggies. Broccoli, bacon, ham, chicken are all good choices, as are spicy peppers.

If it sticks to the pan you didn't use enough butter caramelizing the onions.",
582,Upvote for MSG. Yay umami!,
785,"The Chinese method of cooking veggies isn't usually as boring (and bland) as steamed broccoli - sort of a stir fry but with no meat or soy sauce or anything special other than salt, oil, and garlic. The veggies themselves have wonderful flavor that the garlic brings out.

1. Heat pan (or wok) to medium with some oil (two tbsps?)

2. Chop up garlic to your liking (I love garlic so I use like 3-4 cloves)

3. When pan is hot, throw in garlic

4. When garlic is lightly browned, throw in washed vegetables

5. Salt moderately, stir and cover

8. Taste/check your vegetables - are they still raw? They're not supposed to be soft

9. Eat - enjoy it with the garlic.

937,"Haven't logged in for a while, so I didn't see this comment sooner, but I respectfully disagree that the recipe is a ""poor version of even simple beef stew"" as you put it.

Maybe my grocery store is different than yours, the pre-cut stew beef works just fine for me.  At times, I'll use chuck, bottom round, or any other beef that I happen to be able to get my hands on, and honestly, after 8-10 hours in the crock pot, it's all beef.

As far as the bouillon cubes go, in the recipe it is suggested that you can use canned broth instead if you prefer.  I have used Better than Bouillon base before, and I agree that stuff is great.  However, it's not available everywhere, I can't get it where I am now.  So I'm stuck with bouillon cubes or canned broth.  I don't always have the broth on hand, but I do usually have bouillon cubes/granules.  While I will readily admit that the sodium content is higher than I'd like, there is no MSG in the cubes I use, and they honestly add a nice flavor.  Not all bouillon cubes are created equal, I suppose.

Your other recommendations for cooking are great for someone who has the time to spend in the kitchen browning the meat in small batches, then sauteing the onions, and such.  I'm sure it makes for a great stew, I just usually don't have the time.  This is why I'm much more of a throw it in the crock pot and let it cook on low until I get home kind of person.

Thyme, garlic, butter in addition are also a huge must for me.  

You might disagree with this next part, we all have our preferences. But maybe try to have carrots in at the same time. Theres a certain sweetness carrots impart that sweat onions dont. It fortifies the beef stock and marries well with the wine and Worcestershire. Something like carrots needs to be in from the beginning to add to the over all flavor. If you dont like them, you can cook more on the side to your preference in butter, thyme, and garlic and it wont take away from anything or contrast too harshley. If you add the carrots earlier on, you then wouldnt have to sweat the onions. There are very strong flavors going around in that pot so having a harsher onion flavor marry out with everything else would probably be more beneficial to milder nuances like sweat onions and the faintest introduction of carrots. The sweetest carrots ive found to be reliably consistant and available are bolthouse organic.

Consider coating your meat lightly in season flour when you sear if you want a slightly more bodied sauce.

Edit: everyone keeps suggesting msg... I'm gonna say you dont need it. From beef to Worcestershire, and garlic, with fortified beef stock you have umami pretty well set. Its really a balance game not enough acid- more wine; too weird/out balanced towards acid- more salt; not enough punch- more worcestershire; too simple- more herbs/aromatics.

I dont use it but people are suggesting and I do love tomato paste and beef, it leans more towards an espagnole style sauce but it would be so good, sweet, tangy, thick. I would only suggest you cook out/caramelize the paste rather than just adding it in as is. Then also consider mushrooms as it rounds out the tomato very nicely ( it fortifies as the umami balance)",

Prepare all your ingredients in advance. Make sure the rice is at least room temp, but not hot.

Dump the eggs all at once (unscrambled) into a wok with a tablespoon of oil. Immediately dump the rice and whatever meat you are using and stir it around. Don't wait for the eggs to cook -- the uncooked eggs coats each individual rice grain so it stays separated and helps keep the fried rice from getting too mushy. Season to taste with a dab of oyster sauce, salt and a tiny pinch of sugar. No soy sauce -- it will only make it soggy.


**The OMG I'm craving greasy Chinese food way**

Do the above, except use a lot more oil. A lot, a lot, ALOT. Cook the eggs in enough oil for them to be swimming in it. Dump the rest of the ingredients while the egg is runny, and if it looks like the rice is not getting coated in oil, add more oil until the rice looks shiny. Keep the rice moving in the wok so everything gets coated and fried in oil. Season with salt, a dab of oyster sauce and some MSG. And  no, MSG will not give you a headache. ",

I usually season, brown my meat, remove it, then add my veggies and seasoning I am going to use (onions, carrots, bell/poblano peppers), brown those, then add some tomato paste, let that almost burn on the bottom, then deglaze the whole thing with some liquid (whiskey, apple juice, stock), add some dried peppers with the seeds and tops removed, and cook that whole thing down, then liquify that mixture, in a blender or with a stick, re-add my meat, add some beans, some tomato chunks, adjust your seasoning, add a bunch of MSG (I just use powdered MSG), mix it all together, cover it, pop it in the oven at a low temp until my meat is tender and my consistency is right.  You'll want to use an enameled cast iron pan, and never clean it, you want all the find to stay with you until the end.  Then I always put it in the fridge for a day or two, and reheat for the competition.  I like a chili that is dark red, with small/med chucks of meat, in a thick gravy with a heat that hits the back of your tongue.

Or stand out by doing something weird.  Vegan chili/ white pork/chicken chili, something like that.  My point is that ground beef &amp; bell pepper chili is usually not a winner at these things.",

Signed up just for this question!

\--I use MSG all the time--

I pride myself on my cooking so this isn't just a lazy fool's shortcut (though I'm certainly lazy and can make a fool of myself).  People get squicked out about monosodium glutamate.  It's BS from an older xenophobic generation who came up with the nonsense chinese restaurant syndrome.  There is no science, no peer reviewed study that has ever proven the supposed ill effects of MSG.  Bonded Glutamate is everywhere in 'natural' foods cheese, cooked meat, nuts, and basically anything that's savory like olives, sun dried tomatoes, cooked mushrooms, and in pretty much every processed snack.  The MS means a single sodium atom is bonded to G, the glutamate.  When this molecule goes into solution, the sodium separated from the glutamate.  The sodium ion acts exactly like the sodium in NaCl, plain sodium.  That leaves glutamate.  This is one of the most important neurotransmitters in our brains.  It's essentially is a neurotransmitter that acts to excite and stimulate the neurons it binds to.  To my understanding it increases the activity level and electrical impulses in the neuron.  Glutamate is essential for life!  On a interesting side not, there is a chemical that acts in opposite of glutamate, gaba.  Gaba slows down neural activity.  Glutamate and gaba usually exist in a teeter totter relationship.  That is until you have a beer or take sleep med.  Alcohol and other depressants cause in increase in gaba and thus reduce neural activity.  So if you see NYE revellers tonight, just know that discoordination is due to too much gaba.  A good dose of water, waiting for the ethanol to be metabolized according to its half life, and perhaps a good source of glutamate (think of a burger covered with seared mushrooms, a later of melted cheese, and some bacon, perhaps a sprinkle of MSG) will leave them as best well of as possible the next morning.

Happy New Years!  Enjoy the gabaergics tonight, no driving afterwards, drink water, and make a resolution to buy a small packet of MSG on amazon and make up your own mind.",

231,"MSG is a sodium ion bound to a glutamate, which is an amino acid. The sodium ion is perceived as a salty taste and the glutamate is perceived as that savory ""umami"" taste, hence why MSG adds as much flavor as i does. Neither of these substances are foreign to the body, and are found in varying amounts in many foods (though not in the same proportion and dose as MSG).

In high doses, MSG carries that same risk that a high dose of salt does: that is, it means you take in a lot of sodium which can make you retain fluid, increase blood pressure, and feel really thirsty or dehydrated.

As far as ""Chinese Food Sickness"": People tend not to realize just how much sodium can be in Chinese food - not just from MSG, but from soy sauce, other seasonings, and preservatives added to the food to prevent spoilage. Combine that with typically massive portions often high in fat and carbohydrate as well, a person post-Chinese meal can be feeling pretty sluggish, thirsty, and thus crappy. 

Some people are quite convinced, however, that MSG makes them sick, and they will in fact ""feel"" sick if they have MSG (or are convinced that they had MSG). This has less to do with the MSG itself and more to do with ""mind over matter.""

TL;DR - MSG is not inherently harmful. It can cause some issues in high doses much like salt can. It gets blamed for people feeling crappy after eating Chinese, but the real culprit there is more likely portion size and Calorie density.",

Well, this is bound to generate some controversy. Bagged flavored chips are just as much a product of traditional cuisine as they are of food science. We tend to consider food science products as ""bad"" and traditional cuisine as ""good."" There is a channel on YouTube where chefs try to replicate food products, like skittles, or cheese-it crackers. It's often somewhat tricky. There's an assumption that junk food, because it's junk, is easy to make. It's really not. A lot of science and research and testing and investment goes into developing these guilty pleasures.

I'm sure pre-made flavoring powders are available through vendors that supply food to restaurants. You could also experiment with making your own. I'm sure a bit of research could reveal some general processes for making flavorings. You can order most of the chemical or ingredients directly, I'd assume, since they are unlikely to be controlled substances where you need a lab number or something to buy it.

Anyway, perhaps look on youtube. There does seem to be something of a genre of videos devoted to replicating fast food and junk food favorites at home, using widely available ingredients.

Another thought is to buy various soup and flavoring bases that come in powdered form from your market, and use that as a type of base to which you might add dried spices, and perhaps some citric acid and sugar to try to get something that will adhere to the hot chip, have a strong ""msg style umami taste we associate with chips, and maybe some kinds of powdered cheese products. I think they sell powdered popcorn cheeses. You might also buy some boxed mac and cheese and play with the packets of cheese flavoring.  ",

Umami is one of the primary tastes along with sweet salty bitter and sour. It is triggered by the amino acid glutamate and it is a measurement of the protein in food.

MSG stands for mono sodium glutamate and it is the sodium salt of the amino acid glutamate. It adds umami to dishes. There was once a racist media scare that blamed MSG in Chinese food to some made up health problems but there is no danger to using MSG anymore than there is to comsuming tomatoes or mushrooms.

863,"Wikipedia, which I'm guessing is where your statement ""quite literally not a single bit of scientific evidence"" comes from, cites an article from 2009 as identifying MSG as a potential migraine trigger. It also cites an article from 2006 as the counter-claim, though I'm skeptical when an older article is used to debunk more recent research. An even more recent [study](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1468-2982.2009.01881.x/abstract;jsessionid=E113712E2AAE09F0D47283BF5172B608.d02t02) from 2009 DID find an empirical link between MSG and headaches, so clearly there is something going on here. It might be genetic, and maybe in fact certain people are more sensitive than others. However I think much like serving foods with nuts in them at dinner parties, would you want to risk that for your friends? Not only that, but why dump a ton of salt into food if you can just make better recipes? I never find MSG to be an essential ingredient in my cooking.  ",
356,"&gt;May I ask which restaurant you're going to? I've been to more than 300 restaurants in Nothern NJ and the UK, and I've never tasted mango pulp in CTM.

You probably haven't. I've added this to match a specific version of the dish from a specific restaurant which I specifically wanted to recreate. I think you are massively underestimating how diverse Indian restaurant cooking styles are. Every Indian restaurant makes this dish differently and uses very different ingredients.

&gt;Like the mint in the tikka. There's no mint in tikka.

Again, you are missing the scale of variation between different versions of this dish. When I first started making this dish I didn't used to use mint, then I found a couple of different versions that used mint which adds a subtle background note that I recognised from restaurant versions I wanted to recreate. Mint is commonly used in combination with yoghurt in Indian cooking. If you google recipes for chicken tikka you will see that every single recipe is different and uses a different blend of herbs and spices. They only thing they all have in common is that they use yoghurt. If you don't like it, leave it out

&gt;And the pinch of salt. Are you on a low sodium diet? I've never tasted a CTM with this little salt.

I typically add one half teaspoon of salt to my single portion curries. In this dish it was way too salty. This is because there is also salt in the tikka marinade and there is salt in the tandoori masala and the MSG also contains sodium so you don't need as much salt if you are also using MSG. So I use a lot less salt in this curry than I do for other curries. That being said, it goes without saying that you taste and adjust the seasoning at the end of the cooking.

&gt;And the optional MSG. Optional is certainly better than the recipes that omit it entirely, but, there's absolutely nothing optional about MSG in CTM. You can omit and/or play around with a lot of different stuff, but not MSG. CTM absolutely has to contain MSG.

It's optional because not all restaurants use it and some people specifically avoid it. MSG has only really had widespread use in restaurants over the last 20 years or so and this dish emerged in the UK in the 60s so I think you are over exaggerating more than a little. That being said I always use MSG in this dish. Again, Indian Restaurants are varied.

&gt;I think we're at least 3 years away from cracking the restaurant quality CTM at home code.

The only thing you have in an Indian restaurant that you don't have in a typical home kitchen is a high powered gas stove and an industrial tandoor. This does undoubtedly effect what you can achieve. That being said, this recipe describes ingredients and techniques you could find in a commercial Indian restaurant serving this dish but it's important to recognise that you will not find two Indian restaurants that make this dish the same way. The ""authenticity"" is relative to the majority of CTM posts you find on here and on r/food that don't actually use chicken tikka and so aren't really distinguishable from any other variety chicken curry.

I normally think of it in terms of, the right amount of MSG for a portion is normally the same as the right amount of salt. So I'd normally add about a quarter of a teaspoon per serving for a quarter pounder. MSG contains sodium so you can use slightly less salt if you are using MSG (although it contains about a third of the sodium of salt)

High heat, oil, and don't overcrowd the pan. Drier rice where the grains are more easily separable is ideal, this can be achieved by using left over rice or fresh cooked rice which has been spread out on say a sheet pan near a fan and allowed for excess moisture to escape.

Seasoning can vary depending on the style of fried rice you are after. But typically you are looking at a pinch of sugar, soy sauce(s), and maybe some sesame seed oil. Other seasonings may include oyster sauce, fish sauce, white pepper, or anything your heart desires.

A seasoning tip is to add a pinch of chicken bouillon powder. It adds a bit of savoriness through the chicken flavoring and a touch of MSG for that ""authentic"" taste.

561,"Depending on where you live, visit a farmer's market and look at what's really fresh. A burger's basic parts are meat (main portion - flavorful, juicy, savory, salty), bread (starchy, fluffy), lettuce (crunchy, fresh, light), tomato (acidity, slight sweetness), onions (sharp, spicy), pickles (sour, cuts through saltiness), and condiments such as ketchup (same as tomato) and mustard (spiciness). Keep these parts in mind as you consider what you could replace it with, and what sorts of flavors you want to include.

I personally don't think you can go wrong with more than just a high-quality burger patty, seasoned with salt/fresh cracked black pepper/garlic powder/onion powder/paprika (and a touch of MSG if you're down for that) with some generic sesame-seed buns and a good dollop of ketchup. But I think the key of hamburgers is you make them how YOU like them - mustard? pickles? onions?

I think one of my favorite burgers I've ever had used cheese quesadillas for buns, with homemade tortillas, and had a whole fried egg put on top of the meat, with the top ""bun"" on the side for the customer to smash on top of the burger themself.

Start by scrambling eggs. Use ~1-2 eggs per cup of rice. When the eggs are almost cooked, but still slightly runny, add the rice and a little more oil. Keep frying until the rice is mostly cooked. You can add the salt at this stage. For that authentic restaurant taste, you're going to have to add MSG. Use about as much MSG as salt.

Add the peas and pork and finish cooking the rice. You can add soy sauce if you want but be careful about the salt. When it's cooked add the spring onions and give it a quick stirfry to mix it in. Done.

35,"It it tastes bland, it's probably not salty enough or not sour enough. 
Beginners are often too careful with salt, since they only know what it does when
they directly apply it to their food (e.g. an egg). But if you use it for pasta, you will throw away most of the salt with the water, so you need to use a lot of it.
As a reference, if I cook 300g of Spaghetti with 3 liters of water, I use about a tablespoon of salt. 
Also, monosodium glutamate helps to bring out the flavor of the minced meat (and anything savory, really). I have never used pure MSG, but it occurs naturally in many types of food, such at tomatoes, parmesan, grilled meat etc.
So when you cook minced meat, I suggest that you add a good amount of tomato paste, as it is basically concentrated flavor. When you are not sure about the right amount of salt during cooking, put some of the sauce in a separate bowl and play around with salt &amp; spices there, so you don't mess up the whole pot. ;-)",

1. obtain the following: super soft tofu, garlic, msg, (soy sauce, brown sugar) oil, beech mushrooms, hoisin sauce, green onions,  corn starch, sesame oil
2. heat up wok, throw in garlic with oil  and simmer until fragrant (don't burn garlic)
3. add tofu, add msg, add pinch salt or chicken bouillon, let simmer until the sides of the tofu are visibly cooked
4. mix hoisin ( or soy sauce and brown sugar)  with 1 tsp corn starch and fill with double the water, dump into the pan, let it bubble ( alternatively use soy sauce and sugar together)
5. carefully incorporate with tofu, add mushrooms
6. cut the green onions on a raw cutting board
7. stop the heat, add green onions and sesame oil on top

Your frying technique is fine, if basic, but you're going to want to season the flour a whole lot more. There are seasonings out there besides salt, pepper, and MSG.

928,"I have known for a long time that I've had a sensitivity to MSG.  It's not so much the MS but the G, glutamate.  It's not only found in MSG but also autolyzed yeast extract, and hydrolyzed proteins (to state the most common).  It also occurs naturally in many basic foods, ie tomatoes or cheese.  

Glutamic acid is found in two isomers, L- and D-.  The D- configuration is the naturally occurring isomer and I have not determined my own sensitivity to it.  The -L isomer results from human processing, and this is the one I need to watch out for.  L- is the chirality of glutamic acid found as a food additive and I, for some reason, am very sensitive to it.  If I ingest a small quantity I have no reaction.  There seems to be some threshold I need to cross before I get one of my blinding migraines.  I've also noticed that increased heart rate through exercise increases my chance to react to glutamate ingestion.  This I attribute to an increased accumulation in brain's blood vessels.  

A recent paper published in Nature Genetics indicates there is a genetic marker for glutamate sensitivity, and the researchers have tied it to migraine-like reactions.  Here's the link to Reuters story: http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE67S1PN20100830  The paper itself requires a subscription but can be easily found from that link.  I have read it, but I don't understand it's detail very much.  Genetics is way over my head, however I am have a PhD in chemical engineering and scientific research is my career.  I used research techniques, and myself as a guinea pig, to determine the cause of my migraines.  This is how I determined MSG or glutamate as the culprit.  

Now I try to avoid glutamic acid as best I can and have reduced my migraine incidents to about one per year.  Nobody can completely avoid glutamate.  Most people aren't sensitive and it's not a bad salt to cook with, just not for me.

**tl;dr** Some people are sensitive to MSG.  A recent publication in Nature Genetics is supportive of this claim.",

316,"To over simplify, the way the food industry in many western countries works is that nutrient barren food is often cheaper to produce (primarily because it has a long shelf live, uses preservatives etc) and that low cost is passed on to the consumer.

Which would you choose if you were on a tight budget? Similarly many poorer areas are what is referred to as a ""food dessert"" where you don't find much (if any) fresh produce but instead convenience stores and fast food. In some of these places junk food is often sold cheaper than it is in near by affluent areas; the affluent areas absorb the losses and most purchasing is done in poorer areas. So in essence, many poorer people live in an environment where junk food is both normalised and affordable. Also junk food is typically less filling and calorie dense (meaning you need to eat more to be satiated. Therefore, yes poorer people often can afford to over eat due to the way companies target them and unfortunately this also means higher levels of obesity are associated with lower income areas. ",

Do you know the cause of your acid reflux? Acid reflux can be caused by various things, two of the main reasons though are either you have a insufficient amount of acid in your stomach, or else you have too much.

You should look into those or ask your doctor which you have..

Some things to help control the reflux though is eating smaller meals, instead of large ones, no eating a few hours prior to bed time, and staying away from the 'trouble' foods.. I think they're different for everyone. So maybe just keep a food journal :) Also, warm drinks are more likely to cause your esophagus to relax, letting the acid come up. So try to drink cold things =D. I had to get the surgery to fix this once, if you have any more questions feel free to msg me

As for the lactose intolerance, Interesting fact: Most people who have the intolerance are able to eat yogurts. The cultures in the yogurt break down the lactose enzymes which would usually make you feel like shit :)

But if you're wanting straight up probiotics I reccomend going into the health food section and buying the little probiotic capsules. Those are the surefire way of taking them.

Umami as a separate taste type (which is what it is, caused by the amino acid gluatamate on our taste buds) hit mainstream Western consciousness a while back. So of course there was a lot of buzz around it. There's an actual word and known reason that we particularly enjoy certain foods.

The problem is that in studies (see Wikipedia) it's been shown that the symptoms are psychosomatic. Sounds like the blind taste tests you participated in were just that-- taste tests.

From a cooking perspective, my advice is that you use it to help out the umami in your foods. It definitely enhances the flavor of anything meaty or proteiny as the other redditors have mentioned. But, if you learn how to cook well, you won't need it. Imagine training wheels. It helps you, but you don't necessarily need them. I think it works to make something taste better than it is.

For the fruit apples, (tons of) bananas (until you can't stand them), oranges and the occasional fresh berry (and frozen berries which are cheaper unless it's the season).

Don't forget mushrooms they are expensive per pound but a pound of mushrooms is huge. Crimini white or if on sale Portabella are the way I go.

For produce try to stay under $3.00 per pound unless you have a big influx of cash.  I shoot for  $1.00 a pound but that isn't always feasible.

You want mostly produce.  You can change out bread for tortillas they can be more expensive but they add some versatility.  Read your labels.  You want as little fake crap as possible.  Don't do diet or low fat anything it's fake garbage (I do get diet Dr. Thunder but he's a doctor.)  If you need to lighten up your diet fill up on fruits and veggies. When buying yogurt (or if you splurge cottage cheese).  Read the labels they fill those full of so much fake crap.

I feed my self and my pregnant wife on $45 a week.  About once a month I spend $100 getting staples (and probably other crap too.)

Obviously you can't get everything here for $45 all at once but it gives variety.  So you have to toy with it.  Figure out milk, egs, meat, cheese and bread cost then go buy the rest in produce.

Google lets you type in ingredients and it will suggest recipes IIRC it's that simple.

Go into the store with the exact amount of cash you want to spend and go to it.",

It’s not like brewers yeast as it needs to also go through processing to extract the MSG. I guess it depends on the definition of naturally sourced. Are there any foods that aren’t naturally sourced to some degree.  

Many things we considering artificial are processed from fermentation processes. Lysine for example is basically bacteria and corn that is then processed to leave pure lysine. Many artificial flavorings are made from processed wood pulp and other plant sources (just not the same as the plant whose flavor is being replicated). 

At the end of the day, it’s chemically identical to MSG from seaweed.  So I guess it all doesn’t matter other than to relieve people’s fears. ",

MSG is not a preservative, and nobody had ever been able to prove an actual sensitivity to it in a double blind test.

 ____NEXT COMMENT____ 
The simple answer is that it's a savory flavor enhancer.

It doesn't have a particularly distinct flavor on its own (if you try it, it feels like it's about to taste like salt, but the saltiness never really kicks in). In combination with savory flavors it adds an incredible amount of body/depth to the overall flavor. It's ridiculous how much impact 1/2tsp of the stuff has in a giant pot of soup.

People freak out about crystallized MSG, but if I threw half a tomato and 1/2tsp of salt into that same pot of soup, I just added the exact same amount of MSG.

 ____NEXT COMMENT____ 
Lots of foods have naturally occurring glutamates. Tomatoes, cheese, basically all meats, olives, etc. are good examples of foods that are rich in glutamates. Think of MSG as ""glutamate salt"". It's a glutamate bonded to sodium. As soon as it dissolves, the two break apart.

 ____NEXT COMMENT____ 
The ""umami"" flavor is the taste of free glutamates.

The easiest way to get it is to add MSG to your dish.

Any braised meat dish will also release lots of free glutamates.

 ____NEXT COMMENT____ 
That sounds delicious!

But there is really nothing ""unnatural"" about MSG -- the hubbub about it was all a bunch of nuts making claims that couldn't be reproduced. MSG is naturally occurring in tons of food products, and even simply cooking meat releases glutamates, and seasoning it adds sodium.

 ____NEXT COMMENT____ 
Yes, MSG is a byproduct of producing soy sauce.

If you are trying to avoid all MSG you will also need to stop eating parmesan cheese, tomatoes, oysters, clams, mussels, seaweed, and many others. If you put salt on meat, you also have free sodium and free glutamates.

MSG bolsters that lowest layer - it rounds out the flavour profile of any dish. You can accomplish the same with any umami rich condiment (miso, tomato paste, marmite, for example). MSG is just one way to do that.

the best analogy i can think of is that kimchee is like a slaw. and there are many kinds of slaw. there are tons of varieties of kimchee depending on the kind of vegetable used, but there are certain ingredients that you'll never see used. korean cooks tend to be traditionalists and you will never see current ingredients in there like siracha. 

sorry, but i don't have exact measurements for you, but i do have general guidelines that are consistent in the making of kimchee. basically there is a rotting/fermenting agent. usually it is raw oysters, raw fish, fish sauce (most moms will say to use the fish sauce without the MSG), or dried squid. There is a 4 hour stage that you brine the vegetable in a sugar and salt mixture and wash. this stage is important because it breaks down the cellular structure. do it too long and the kimchee will be mush. not enough and it will not ripen correctly. you won't get that tangy, bubbly, crunchy texture. instead, it will smell like old socks also i have a theory that if you don't wash your hands correctly or if you introduce harmful bacteria, the fermentation process will not work properly and the kimchee will be funky.

anyway, after the brine mix in coarse dried red pepper, (fine red pepper is only used for color but add some anyway), kosher salt or sea salt, sugar, garlic, ginger and a rotting agent. If you are using napa you need to rub it in to each individual leaf. that is basically it. you add onions for sweetness, too much and the kimchee turns out slimy. you add ""buchu"" i think americans call it garlic chive. i think chinese call it gao choy. garlic chive will add the garlic and onion flavor. you can add green onion / scallion and or daikon radish. its the same ingredients that you see koreans use in all of their dishes. 

also about fermenting, since it is cold out. you can leave it out for a few days to ripen. leave the jar cracked open and make sure there is space left in the jar because the liquid will rise. in 70 degree weather, i think one day out. and put it back into the fridge. a slow fermentation will make for a crunchier texture. add too much salt and the fermentation process will take longer, but also the kimchee will last longer before it goes into no mans land.

don't trust any recipe that says to add red bean paste or siracha. and 
sorry for the format. i was just writing it as i was thinking it. oh yeah, if you are making cucumber kimchee, make sure to blanch it for a few seconds to take off the wax.

Now it's this mystical fifth sense, which people like to attribute to different things.

I hate to ruin the romance here, but I'm Japanese and ""umami"" is the flavor of MSG.  Discerning umami in Parmesan, bacon, mushrooms, etc. is just saying that those things remind you of MSG.

 ____NEXT COMMENT____ 
Salads:  dead simple a lot of times and very good for you.  Lettuce, spinach, tomatoes, onions, olives, carrots, cabbage, mushrooms, etc, etc.  Chop it up, add dressing and presto.  Hell, a salad for me a lot of times is cucumber chunks, lemon juice, salt, and chili powder.

Oatmeal: Oats, milk or water, raisins, cinnamon, and apple slices.  Throw everything into a pot, except perhaps the apples.  Boil it and then simmer it covered mostly until it looks good.  Add more liquid if you think it's too dry.

""Fries"":  Cut potatoes or sweet potatoes up into chunks or wedges, throw them on a baking sheet.  Throw on some olive oil, salt and pepper, then put them in a 300-400 F oven for a while.  Extra bonus points if you add cheese towards the end of cooking them.  I'm not sure how cheese would work on sweet potatoes though.  But hey, it never hurts to experiment and I'll probably give that a shot now asap.

Burgers:  Should be a no brainer mostly aside from the patties?  I like salmon as it can be excellent and is probably pretty healthy for you.  A can of wild caught salmon, egg or two, bread crumbs, dijon mustard, some herbs and spices.  Mix all that together and fry it up in olive oil.  Not too long as you don't want to dry it out so much.

""Stir fry"":  basically anything goes here, but an Americanized stir fry might be something like onions, carrots, bean sprouts, and ground pork.  Throw stuff in a skillet with some cooking oil and fry it up.  You want your veggies cooked but still crispy mostly, so start with the meat (and dried chilis!) and do not over cook the veggies.  Also the meat is mainly for flavor so use it sparingly.  Season with some soy sauce, salt, pepper, rice vinegar, and sesame oil.  A typical way for me to cook spinach involves just oil, garlic, spinach, pepper, and sometimes vinegar.  EDIT: corn starch at the end if you want to thicken it up a tad.

That's off the top of my head.  I'll probably think up some other junk here in a few.

More:

Stock:  Onions, garlic, carrots, celery, mushrooms, etc.  You could go nuts on the veggies.  Also spices like salt, pepper, rosemary, junk like that, there can be multiple variations.  Keep it simple though at first and don't add too much, perhaps 1/2 onion, 2 cloves garlic, a carrot or two, and salt and pepper to taste.  Cover that with water, add some chicken/beef/lamb, and boil it for a bit.  Strain it if you want the straight broth.  Simply remove bones from the chicken if you're going for a soup later on.

Soups/stews:  This is one thing out of many that your stock can be used for.  Mexican and Asian soups tend to pair cinnamon with beef and I have to say I'm a big fan.  Pho is one example, and birria I believe is another.  Do the cinnimon nuttiness during your stock phase of course, but again, start out simple, so forget cinnamon altogether to begin with.  Try and make something simple like chicken noodle soup.  Me, I'm a big fan of Asian style breakfast soups (some would call it porridge I guess).  Chicken or seafood stock, rice, and veggies, the variations are endless.  Mine turned out spectacular the other day:  fatty pork (sorry, say no to bacon on this, or please say yes and let me know how it goes) with a boat load of fish sauce (careful here, a boatload to you might be a few drops, but I think I went 3 TB in a reall small pan), fresh minced ginger, onions, and sugar, covered in water and simmered until tender.  I added to that a ton of rice and dried chilis.  Heaven.

Slightly less nutty Asian breakfast soup, for the less fish sauce inclined:  rice, chicken stock, onions, and any greens you have on hand, from spinach to lettuce to etc.  Throw it all together, cook until done, remove from heat and drop an egg or two in it.  Blah blah blah, yeah, thicken it up with corn starch, swirl it around and only add egg whites or something so you get the crazy egg drop soup swirl look?  I'm too lazy.  Anyhow, garnish with cilantro perhaps?

Spanish rice:  Go with brown rice I say.  2 to 1 ratio of rice to broth roughly.  No need to be too exacting, but if you want to be I'm sure you could look some precise recipe junk up online.  Start out with some butter, salt, and onions frying up in a soup pan.  Add minced garlic, perhaps some spices like cumin, and uncooked rice after the onions soften up a tad.  Add a jalepeno or habanero or bell pepper or something at this point.  Add a tomato or two or three after a few mins.  Add the chicken stock.  Bring to a boil, simmer, and somewhat follow the rice package's cooking times.  Cilantro is a must add at the end, and perhaps you'll want to try lime juice too.

Pan fried chicken:  Coat your chicken in a mix of flour, lots of salt (or not so much if you're not trying to go KFC style.  Perhaps some MSG is in order if you do like KFC?), and lots of hot pepper and dried chili.  If you're looking for 21 original spices, look it up online, but I think salt is the key ingredient with peppers and chilis being a close second.  Anyway, get a frying pan, add 1/8 of an inch of oil.  Do not use too much as you're not exactly deep frying the junk.  And don't go too hot on the heat as again you're not exactly deep frying the junk.  Cook it uncovered for a good long while until it looks good.  Hopefully you did it right and it's crispy and not too oily on the outside and actually cooked on the inside.  If not, rinse repeat.  I've found 3-4 on my electric stove works nicely.  Your stove may vary.

TLDR?  I think a major point you should get out of my post is this:  Just start cooking.  Find some foods you like and experiment with making them.  Yeah, it's going to turn out god awful some times.  Or at least I'm no prodigy and it certainly does on my end.  But I can definitely say I'm getting better at it.  My crazy semi Asian breakfast soup from the other day is an absolute testament to my improving.  Hell, I made fried wontons not too long ago that I'd be proud to serve at a restaurant.",

The first challenge is proving the condition exists, and there's literally no way to sort a nocebo/placebo effect from a real but vague health issue without some kind of controlled study.  


That's not the same as a flat-out denial that the condition exists, but it is certainly a skeptical approach. Many people believe they have a sensitivity to grains or MSG when very little evidence exists to support it, and those allergies can both be traced back to either a fake claim (in the case of MSG) or a study that didn't hold up to further research (non-gluten wheat sensitivity, though I realize there is a little more complexity to that issue.)  


And to be clear, it doesn't matter whether the person had doubts or a negative attitude going in; changing your diet in a significant way, especially by eliminating things you like, could always have a mental effect that would be challenging to suss out.  


Before we can diagnose the underlying causes of failure to thrive on a vegan diet, we'd need to prove it's a real condition. I'd love to see people like OP recruited for a blinded study. Design would be a challenge of course, as you'd have to manage to blind a patient to the food they're eating, and you also couldn't actually put ethical vegans in an experimental group where they were given a non-vegan diet. But I'd love to see OP and other ""FTT"" vegans sign up for a study where they are given a diet where the food is all blended into a homogenous shake or difficult-to-identify substance, and they eat that diet for several months. They report how they're feeling, and we see if there is truly a detectable difference between the diets in FTT people.   


Of course I believe OP did poorly on the diet, but nocebo effects aren't ""fake."" They're completely real, and can have physical manifestations, and that's especially true with things like lack of energy.",

Assuming that you're comparing your home cooked curries to Indian restaurant (IR) food, there's two things going on here.

First, online IR recipes pretty much all suck.  They're usually influence by books written by Indian home cooks.  Indian restaurant food is entirely different to Indian home cooking. If the recipe isn't influenced by a book, it's usually just people guessing, and guessing invariably fails miserably.

Second, and this won't fix a bad recipe, but all domestic Indian restaurants add msg to their food.  Even if you happened across the perfect recipe, if it omitted the MSG, it would still be on the bland side.  There's no more critical ingredient to IR food (and restaurant food, in general) than MSG.

Glutamates are unbelievably fucking delicious- in any form. This can mean browned chicken skin, the fond on a pan from steak, the parm in fettucine alfredo, the tomato sauce and cheese on pizza, the soy sauce in Chinese takeout.  Without glutamates, food would taste... like nothing.

The only time that glutamates are not quite so delicious is when they're added to excess- which can be pretty easy to do if one is heavy handed with the msg. Cool Ranch Doritos, I think, are a bit of an abuse- at least the modern extra-msg extreme version is.  But dishes that don't naturally have a great deal of glutamates, such as, say chilli, always benefit from a little msg.

 ____NEXT COMMENT____ 
Yes, there's some umami in the tomatoes, but a little MSG helps, especially in the face of the slight flavor masking you see with the cream.

To me, Indian restaurant food is a lot like Chinese restaurant food, but with a little less Westernization.  Just like you wouldn't omit soy sauce from classic brown sauce preparations, you'd never omit msg from any of the gravied dishes.

 ____NEXT COMMENT____ 
May I ask which restaurant you're going to?  I've been to more than 300 restaurants in Nothern NJ and the UK, and I've never tasted mango pulp in CTM.

Respectfully, the recipe feels off. I reads a lot like a non Indian/non Indian restaurant employee watched the onion gravy videos on the internet and guessed on everything else- not that someone has to be Indian to make it well- but some kind of industry exposure is important, I think.

Like the mint in the tikka.  There's no mint in tikka. 

And the pinch of salt.  Are you on a low sodium diet? I've never tasted a CTM with this little salt.

And the optional MSG. Optional is certainly better than the recipes that omit it entirely, but, there's absolutely nothing optional about MSG in CTM.  You can omit and/or play around with a lot of different stuff, but not MSG.  CTM absolutely has to contain MSG.

Don't get me wrong, I'm sure this tastes very good, but I think we're at least 3 years away from cracking the restaurant quality CTM at home code.

 ____NEXT COMMENT____ 
You're probably not going to want to hear this, but, as of right now, I don't think a viable recipe exists for making restaurant quality butter chicken at home.  I've worked on it, and, over time, I've gotten closer, and I've figured some things out, but I'm still not there.  I think we're about 3 years away.

So I can't give you a recipe, but I do know what recipes don't work, and what pitfalls to avoid. As you keep your eye out for viable recipes, here are some critical things you should look for:

1. MSG.  Look for msg in the recipe- if it omits it, the recipe is garbage.  Butter chicken/CTM HAS to contain msg. Even it the recipe includes it, but makes it optional, I would still toss the recipe, since is shows a very clear lack of understanding of Indian restaurant food.
2. Fat.  You don't need to use ghee, but you need to go pretty heavy with the butter.  You also want to make sure the marinade for the chicken contains whole milk yogurt.
3. Sugar.  A good recipe will have a quantity of sugar that will make you go ""whoah, that's a lot of sugar"" when you read it.
4. Lots of onions, cooked for a long time.  
5. Incredibly careful sauteing of the garlic- you never want your garlic to color.
6.  A very light hand with the garam masala.  I think you've already figured this out.
7. Your local takeout is probably using cubed chicken breast, but, boneless skinless thighs will give you exponentially more flavor and juiciness. Grilling them over very hot charcoal is extra work, but it will match the tandoor much better than a home oven will.
8. If the recipe comes from a book, it's highly suspect.  Indian restaurant food cooks don't write books.  Eventually this might change, but, right now, the books out there are all from a perspective of Indian food, not Indian restaurant food.
9. American and British butter chickens vary.  The bases you see online are all British, and they can get a little funky, with things like parsnips.  The Brits also tend to like coconut milk, which is nice, but different. I see you're in Canada, which might be American influenced or British, but you should be able to taste coconut milk if your favorite place is using it.

I've added sauce and cheese to naan and melted it under the broiler on many occasions, but I wouldn't describe it as 'good pizza.'  A huge part of good pizza is the way the cheese melts.  In order to give off it's fat and flavor, cheese needs to bubble, boil and fry.  Broiling cheese only partially melts it and browns and blisters the top, leaving completely unbubbled/unboiled, less flavorful cheese below this blistered top layer. You'll never get as good of a melt under the broiler as you do on a proper pizza where the steam from the raw dough transfers heat up to the cheese and helps it bubble and fry.  Once you parbake dough, be it french bread, an english muffin, or naan, instead of the dough transferring heat to the cheese, it insulates it, and ruins any chance of a good melt.

This is how cheese on previously bake bread, any kind of previously baked bread tends to look:

http://www.freetobesite.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/English-muffin-pizzas1-1024x729.jpg

This cheese hasn't bubbled or rendered any of it's milkfat- at all.  Even if you leave it under the broiler and give it more color, it will never have the same flavor as cheese that gets heat from the rising steam of raw dough.  This is what a good melt looks like:

Do you see the difference?

 ____NEXT COMMENT____ 
If you think, for second, that a mall place selling $10 butter chicken isn't using MSG, you're highly mistaken.

And this doesn't mean to just take this recipe and add msg.  It means that, because it's msg free, it's pedigree is incredibly suspect.

Dried fenugreek leaves are quite common in Indian restaurant cooking, and they do add a certain extra something, but, trust me, they are not the secret to restaurant quality butter chicken at home.

Edit: And a recipe without onions? Do you really think there's Indian restaurants that make gravies without their very famous onion base?


 ____NEXT COMMENT____ 
As has been mentioned, less msg is definitely more.  You're not looking for ranch dressing.  

I'd be lost without my dash, pinch and smidgeon measuring spoons.  For two portions, I'd recommend no more than a smidgeon of msg- maybe even half a smidgeon.

Apart from salads, it is popular with dishes such as okonomiyaki, takoyaki and yakisoba and may also accompany katsu and karaage. It is sometimes served with cooked vegetables, or mixed with soy sauce or wasabi and used as dips. It is also common in Japan to use mayonnaise on pizza.

Thank you guys, i’ll just add the recipe. It’s a really really simple one.

Ingredients

1 whole 700 grams chicken with skin, 1 sweet potato, 4 baby potato (cut into halves), a bunch of asparagus, 1 onion ( cut into half),  corn, 5-6 cloves of garlic and half a lime

Marinate:

3 tbsp salt ( sounds a lot but it’s fine), 2 tbsp coarse pepper, 1 tsp cayenne pepper, 1 tbsp garlic powder, 3 tbsp egyptian chili paste (if you don’t have this just use any sauce, sometimes I use hot nandos sauce), 5 tbsp melted salted butter, 2 tbsp mixed dried herb

Method:

Mix all the ingredients in the marinate, should become a thick slurry and then mix it well with the ingredients (specially rub that chicken well, but gently, you don’t wanna tear the skin). Take the cloves of garlic and stuff it inside the chicken. Now take a roasting bag and throw everything together. Cook the chicken at 180*C for 45 mins, then 210*C for 20 mins and then remove it from the bag and place it on a baking tray. Then bake it at 220*C for 5 mins each side. Once it’s cooked turn on the grill in the oven and cook both sides till the skin looks golden and crispy. 

The fat/gravy that’s left over at the end, you can dip your bread with it and enjoy!

Note: ppft I realized I am horrible at writing recipes, if you have any confusion just msg me, i’ll explain it. I also took some lame photos during the cooking process so i’ll stick that in too!

Add some bread or croutons when you go to bake the mac and cheese.

Try some different cheeses.  Gouda is especially nice to mix in to mac and cheese and you can buy goat gouda for those in your life who are intolerant of cows' milk.

Speaking of spicing up meals, what spices do you use?  Here's what I use:

Rooster Sauce - Sriracha is a delicious (and inexpensive) hot sauce that you can add to anything.  It works well in chili, omelets and really anything that you want a little extra heat in.

Cinnamon - This is an underrated spice.  It's for more than just cookies.  It goes great with Salmon and mixes well with other meat dishes, like Spaghetti.  Try it out on dishes when you think it *won't* work; you'll be surprised.  (I will make bets with the professional cook I live with whether it will work in dishes when she asks me to taste and recommend spicing- I can't cook worth a darn but I can season with the best of them.  I seldom lose these bets over cinnamon.  She thinks that it is just not meant for certain dishes.  Do not allow those rules to rule your seasoning.)

Chili powder - I use this to surprise her with flavor, just like cinnamon.  Try it out in dishes like your mac and cheese.

Old Bay - It is for more than just seafood.  We use it almost as much as butter.  It goes great on some pastas, any greenery (if it's green and you're buttering it- try it with Old Bay).  Don't leave it off of your baked potatoes, either.

Fish Sauce - Be very careful with this.  Only 1-3 drops (3 is really pushing it) are needed to add ""umami"" (savory) to any liquid dish.  It goes great with ramen.  (Think the tasty MSG flavor without the headaches and/or cancer.)

Speaking of Ramen, it's one of my best dishes, according to my much-foodier-than-I girlfriend.  Don't stop with the flavor packet (you can leave it out completely, if you're feeling froggy).  Chili powder, garlic (powdered or fresh), fish sauce *and cinnamon* are your friends.",

And as for all those other suggestions I gave, they all have pretty strong flavors (and MSG for that matter), but I figure for anyone afraid of MSG itself, might as well go for something they're okay with.

432,"I've eaten rice at nearly every meal my entire life, one of the hazards of having a Japanese mother.  Yet even now, when I make fried rice with soy sauce, I couldn't tell you how much to use.  I just make sure that the pan is hot enough that when the soy gets down to the metal itself, it steams.  And I just pour, fold, pour, fold...  until it gets to a color I like, and then I will taste a bit of it.

Use short grain rice.  Long grain rice sucks, and I guess Chinese restaurants use it because it is cheap. But steam your short grain rice (not too soft, if anything, use just a hair less water in your steamer when you make it).  

The way I make fried rice is kind of like this.  I cook my meat in a pan with oil in it (maybe 1-3 tablespoons, depending on the type of meat), once it is done I will drain the oil from the meat off of the pain (like say...  bacon grease.  Drier meats, like pork doesn't need this), I will add egg (if I want egg in it), then any vegetables that I might want to add, and give it just a minute (until the egg is done).  I make sure there is still some visible oil in there, to coat the rice.  When the rice is in the pan, you just steady move it (season it too, salt/pepper/msg/usually garlic powder), so it doesn't get hot enough to cook the rice itself more on the bottom of the pan.  *Then* you just start mixing in your soy sauce, and it should steam a fair bit and put out a hell of a good soy aroma when it hits the bottom of the pan.  But the rice should only be in the pan before you pull it for a couple of minutes, just remember that the rice is already cooked.

About my favorite combo for making a soy fried rice is pork &amp; shrimp.  I will add egg into it, green onions, later add the rice, and lastly the soy last. ",
27,"i am often the designated cook on camping/hiking trips. 

would be nice to know how many people you're cooking for but in any event here's some great advice:

don't forget the dry beans. and rice of course.  throw some well smoked ham (which will keep unrefrigerated for quite a few days) and it's a very hearty satisfying rejuvenating meal.  just soak the beans starting in the morning and then add the ham in chunks to the pot when you finish the cooking on the beans that evening.  look for a smoked pork hock, the skin of the pork hock can be toasted over the fire. mmmm cracklins.

you might be burning up to six thousand calories per day and that will make for some hungry times so plan for large portions.  there's nothing like fat to really make you satiated and bring your body back into equilibrium with the modern city diet to which we've all become accustomed. don't cheap out on the oil and butter.  strong flavours like chili, pepper, garlic, onions will be appreciated.  also salt, if you sweat anywhere near as much as I do, you'll want to plan to replenish salt on par with water. this is as easy as some cheap potato chips and/or salted nuts.  also, seasoning whatever you cook well with salt will help with making it taste really good for your fellow hikers. 

avoid msg and too much caffeine (ie caffeine pills + hiking = bad) as these can cause sore muscles sooner, which ache for unreasonably extended periods. note that msg is in many prepared products and the law says that it only be listed simply as 'salt' or 'yeast extract' on ingredients list, at least in most areas. 

if you must bring meats, make sure they're preserved well ie canned, smoked, stuffed with preservatives. i really urge you to bring the smoked pork but freeze it before you leave and keep it insulated, just to be on the safe side. i took smoked ribs on a four day hike, and they kept frozen solid wrapped in the middle of my pack for a full 48 hours. i actually had to thaw them before i ate them.

don't forget a nice bottle of booze if you're into that sort of thing. don't break it out until night three or so, should be a nice little surprise if no one else thought of it first. 

learn to catch fish, if you're hiking for six days you'll probably be near somewhere that is rarely fished and if you do, you might have a good little bonus around the campfire one night.  really fun to catch a fish, and adds to the outdoor experience in a way you can't fathom until you've done it. bring a lemon. also tinfoil is your friend. this goes for potatoes and onions too, those little buddies on a campfire can be reaaaaaly good and salty and oily and num num nums. wrap them all up in a tightly sealed purse and plop them on some rocks beside the fire, as close to 400 degrees as you can estimate.

high calorie items in addition to the above and other posters:  avocado.  oil.  ramen are salty and high calorie.  coconut (milk or whole - a curry with cauliflour and potato might be tasty and satisfying) , deep fried tofu (keeps better than the other types as it is par cooked)

more info on your hike pls

another popcorn protip is not to use microwaveable popcorn because not only is it full of hydrogenated palm kernel oil which is responsible for the massive amounts of pollution, deforestation and worker exploitation, it's also terribly bad for you. not to mention the lining used in the bags or the liklihood of HFCS or artificial sweeteners, MSG, preservatives etc.

just buy some bulk kernels, put a pot on your stove on max with a bit of cooking oil till it gets hot, cover the bottom of the pan with a single layer of kernels and lid the pot, shaking constantly. in my experience it's not only better tasting, better for you, less expensive, more responsible consumption: BUT ITS FUCKING FASTER THAN THE FUCKING MICROWAVE HOLY SHIT",
623,Why the anti-MSG message here?,
565,"For breakfast, my favorite cheap, easy, healthy, tasty meal is ""spicy black beans and eggs on whole grain toast"". You can probably guess how it's made, but here's a recipe anyway: 

* Heat up a bit of olive oil in a pan, and stick your favorite brand of whole grain bread into the toaster. 
* When the pan is hot, crack an egg into it. Scramble with a spatula until about halfway cooked
* Spoon a few dollops of canned black beans and a generous helping of hot sauce right on top. Continue to scramble until done, then scoop the entire mess on top of your toast.

By the way, a notable advantage of whole grain bread is that it has a much longer shelf life than white bread. I go one step further and get ""[double fiber whole wheat](http://www.naturesownbread.com/NAT_Varieties/Variety.cfm?CategoryID=100&amp;ProductID=16)"" which never goes bad. Ever.

Fried rice is ridiculously easy to make, and cheap to boot. The best part is that it takes advantage of leftover food. There are plenty of recipes out there, but here's a (relatively) short version: 

* Heat up canola oil in a pan, toss in whatever vegetables and/or meat you want in the rice. This can be leftovers you have from a previous meal, cheap frozen veggies, or those of the fresh variety. 
* When this stuff is heated, add rice. Leftover rice that has been sitting in the refrigerator actually works better, but fresh rice is okay too. 
* Stir everything until the rice is completely coated with oil, then push it to the side and crack an egg in the pan. Scramble that motherfucker and mix it with the rice.
* Toss in some soy sauce. You can add whatever other spices you think will taste good at this point - I like garlic powder, lemongrass, coriander seed, MSG, or whatever strikes my fancy at the time. Continue to stir everything until the brown from the soy sauce has spread out evenly over the rice, then turn the heat off and prepare to serve.

Stir-fry is even easier. All you really need to know is: Oil, meats and veggies, soy sauce, spices, maybe sesame oil, a stove, and a pan. Combine all those ingredients and stir. Serve with rice.

We all know that mercury is the sweetest of the heavy metals, and canned tuna is the best source of mercury on the consumer market. It's also cheap, nonperishable, easy to prepare, and otherwise healthy. The laziest option by far is tuna salad, which is a fine sandwich filler. This is just tuna, mayo, chopped celery, and whatever spices you think would taste good.

Also: Peanut butter. I think [this stuff](http://www.amazon.com/Smart-Balance-Natural-Peanut-16-Ounce/dp/B001M22TA4/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=grocery&amp;qid=1280168401&amp;sr=8-1) is really goddamn good tasting, and leagues healthier than Jif, Peter Pan, and the like. But whatever your choice, peanut butter goes on everything, from fruit to bread to crackers to a spoon. One of my favorite applications is the peanut butter, banana, and honey sandwich, which I will not insult you by providing a recipe for.

Some other things to investigate that I won't go into because my interest in the subject is fading by the moment: Spaghetti, baked macaroni and cheese, tacos, bean dip, and chicken wings. Anyway, good luck!

OP: one technique you may want to try: Layer your ingredients from faster cooking to slowest cooking. 

For example, if I'm doing a chicken alfredo, I pre-cook the chicken, then lay it directly on the sauce. Then smother with cheese, then my spinach, then onions, and finally tomatoes. 

So if your sausage is pre-cooked, bury it so it doesn't cook away to oblivion, and you give your tomatoes time to gut hot and cook down a bit, and let your crust crisp up a little more.

I was tested for food intolerances and MSG was/is one of them. I used to get a mild then decent headache, drowsy, and then I would pass the fuck out. No joke I once ate some take out food that I didn't check the ingredients on (KFC IIRC) and got about 2 pieces in before my eyes were drooping, about 10 minutes later I was asleep and was so for the next 3 hours or so. 

Currently I will get a mild headache, and get drowsy and will mostly recover in about 2-3 hours. 

But I can tell if there is a specifically added amount in it, for sure. Yes I'm aware it is naturally occurring in small amounts in many food items.

Yes I'm sure there are people who claim to be adverse to this that and the other and are attention whores, but trust me, it would be far easier to not have to check ingredients for a quarter of the stuff I put in my mouth, or to not have to deal with the consequences when I don't or when I say 'ah fuck it', but I do.

I absolutely hate that any Chinese type place I go into I have to ask about it, not be able to trust their answer as they often premake things like eggrolls or use bought in sauces that they don't know the ingredients of, or marinate their meats in an MSG sauce, so even if you specifically request no MSG, you'll often get at least some. Ditto for most soups, fish/turkey/chicken/vegetable/beef stock (liquid and cubes), powdered flavoring packets (such as for sloppy joes, fajitas, taco mix), pain in the ass just to make shitty food taste better than it's ingredients would otherwise allow it to taste.

So, in gauging your reaction to MSG I might also ask for your opinion on how you like soy sauce and parmesan cheese, because eating foods containing these is no different chemically than eating some other foods that have been cooked with MSG.

* 1/4 cup vinegar
* 1/4 cup soy sauce
* 1/2 tbsp onion powder
* 1/4 tsp accent (msg)
* 1/4 tsp black pepper
* 1/4 tsp garlic powder

656,"1). Get some bacon, beef liver, and onions.  Fry the bacon in the (pre-seasoned) pan.  Pull the bacon out and dry it on some paper towels, but leave the grease in the pan.  Dredge the liver in some flour (maybe spiked with some garlic powder and MSG).  Slice and saute the onions with a pinch of salt in the grease.  Dredge the liver again in the flour and cook it until GBD (golden brown &amp; delicious).  If you didn't think you liked liver, you will now.

2.) Save some bacon and some of the grease if it isn't too contaminated with flour.  Put 3 eggs in a bowl and whisk with 3 T water or 2 T half and half or 2T heavy cream, in increasing order of desirability.  Throw a healthy slab of cooled bacon grease or butter in the pan until it barely smokes.  Drop in the eggs and manipulate until you have a reasonably smooth ""patty"" (GBD on the bottom) with some runny stuff on top.  This takes a little practice to get right, but the experiments are still good eating.  Flip it over mid-air (this takes even more practice) or use a plate to make it a two-step process.  But a nice handful of sharp cheddar and some chopped bacon on one half.  When the cheese has almost melted, fold over.  Perfect omelet.  Or leave out the bacon and slather the top with salsa and some hot sauce: spanish omelet.

3.) Find a way to get your pan as hot as possible - outdoors.  I like a butane stove ($20 at a Chinese grocery with extra butane) but a grill works as well; put it ON the hot coals or burner.  You want it HOT.  Take a nice steak and rub some canola or peanut oil on it with your hands, then salt on both sides.  Let rest for 10 minutes.  Throw the steak in the pan and LEAVE IT ALONE for 2 minutes. Don't move it until it releases easily from the pan. Flip and repeat.  If your pan was hot enough you now have a great medium-rare steak.

There's no question that it's injection brined - I'm sure the holes close up during cooking. I've seen some TV shows (like How it's Made) and many of the deli meats are injected and vacuum tumbled in a marinade. They are cooked and then vacuum sealed and cooled.

Is the product a solid muscle like a whole top round or such? If not, then it's probably been also tumbled and multiple muscles vacuum sealed to create a solid piece of meat. After it's cooked, the plastic is removed it it goes through a hot oven to give it a dark surface. Probably also treated with coloring.

If I was going to try it, I would make up a marinade of garlic and whatever other spices or herbs you want to try. Include a good portion of MSG as this is commonly used to bump up the flavor. Puree the mixture with some water, let it sit in the fridge for a day or so to extract and then strain so only liquid is left. Then I would take an injector and pump in the liquid into the beef (as I noted, it's probably top round). Do this repeatedly (like 50 times) - then vacuum seal the meat along with the liquid for a day in the fridge.

After a day, remove and dry well. If the product in the deli is very dark, then you need a coloring agent - mix some worchester or soy sauce with some beef stock base (I like Better than Bullion) and rub over the meat.

Save some of the veg, brown them with some garlic and tomato paste if you have and add water to make a veg stock. Strain and toss the veg. Use that instead of the expired cubes since even when they are not expired, they're just a compressed cube of MSG and salt.

If you have any anchovies, they can add some ""meatiness"" to your stock. Soak them for about 1/2 hour in milk (or water). Add 3 or 4 chopped to your soup. They'll dissolve and add a nice taste. Watch your additional salt though.

 ____NEXT COMMENT____ 
Sigh. I'm going to sound shitty here but the recipe is not very yummy to me. I respect your right to cook however you like and yummy anything you wish. But frankly this recipe seems like a poor version of even simple beef stew. Anything which recommend bouillon cubes and pre-cut supermarket stew beef is going to end up with a poor version of stew.

With just about 10 minutes extra, you can turn out a far superior version. Here's what I would do to improve this.

First, don't buy supermarket stew beef. It's always cheap, bitty cuts from the rump - nasty and livery. Just buy a nice piece of chuck, either a big slab or a nice chuck roast. Cut it up yourself into larger (1-2"" or so) pieces.

Second, don't use cubes - they're just salt and MSG. Find a nice commercial beef stock - Swanson is good. However, if you're going to make this often, invest in some Better than Bullion brand stock base. It's in a small black jar and you can make as little or as much as you like mixing the base with water. Keeps in the fridge for a long time. Many professional chefs use stock base in their recipes.

Now, to start brown the beef cubes in a pot to a very brown color. Do in small batches - if you see a lot of liquid you have too many pieces.

Take out the beef and saute the onions in some oil in the same pan. Scrape up the brown bits. 

When the onions are soft (couple of minutes), deglaze the pan with some of the beef stock (1/4 cup or so) or even better use some nice red wine. Scrape hard to dissolve the brown bits (fond). If you used wine, cook for a few minutes until reduced.

If you like you can now continue the recipe with the beef, browned onions and the little liquid left. Frankly, I would skip the crock all together and finish the recipe on the stove or in the oven. Only takes about 2 hours cooking time.

Thanks and hope my suggestions are taken in the spirit of good cooking.

Turkey meatloaf is another one that is mildly flavored and just requires stirring in a bowl then baking.

Asian and chicken breast are good.  Chicken has no flavor, you  must season it for it to be good. MSG, sugar, garlic and ginger are the key seasonings there.  Don't freak on the MSG, soy sauce is just a natural MSG concentrator.  You can use soy sauce, teriyaki is soy-sugar-sesame oil

 ____NEXT COMMENT____ 
Grew up in exactly your situation. Experiment, and try recipes which use odd ingredients (to you), and follow them even if you think it will suffer.  

Stir fry is garlic+ginger, sugar and soy sauce or MSG for clear.  Garlic, ginger, and any onions if used go in first (aromatics), then meat.  Veggies next.  Meats may need to be removed and held aside if they cook too fast. Cook until veggies are tender-crisp while constantly stirring.

That's actually good advice for any cuisine: Hot oil, garlic and onions, then brown meat.  Never underestimate the power of browning.  Caramel is sugar, cream and butter browned, it obviously is better than it's parts. 

Hummus is healthy and can be spiced up to your taste level.  Garbanzos, tahini, olive oil, lemon juice, garlic, cumin, optionally coriander and hot sauce. Blend, let set for an hour or more in fridge.

Not MSG, just glutamic acid which results in the *umami* ""taste"" (really more a *feel* as we describe it in English).

Of course demi-glace has it; you find glutamate in almost anything protein-rich (like a strong veal stock + espagnole) although kombu is best for Japanese cooking (and not as good as fish sauce in most Western cooking) due to the flavour.

 ____NEXT COMMENT____ 
People who are sensitive to MSG are sensitive to it when uncooked or undercooked, and I've participated in blind taste tests, as have my entire family. Cooked out, such as in soups, it has no effect, but added to raw, cold or stir-fry (hence ""Chinese restaurant syndrome"", a phrase coined by the NEJM), its effects can be noticeable, to the point of triggering severe migraines.

If you're in need of umami, try adding a little Thai fish sauce. It doesn't make things taste fishy and it adds the savoury/fullness you're looking for. It works especially well in vinaigrettes and tomato sauces as well as with beef and, of course, seafood.

You can also get loads of umami by soaking some kombu seaweed. Rinse the kombu to remove the salt, then basically make a tea out of a palm-sized piece. After steeping 10 minutes you have nearly flavourless, umami-rich water for food prep. Bonus: the remaining kombu leaf is edible and useful for recipes and decoration.

Not when processed fully, normally meaning ""cooked out"". Shake MSG (Accent/Zest) on a salad, I'll be unhappy inside 15 minutes, but use it in while sauteing herbs &amp;/or shallots you then use in a dressing, no problem. Same for most of them.

Gelatin is not MSG, nor are the yeast products. Glutamic acid occurs naturally; MSG is a *sodium salt* of the acid. The site you cite probably had their sights on truthinlabeling.org who (for want of a little basic chemistry understanding) also miss the distinction between the two.

No. We weren't tasting *for* MSG or even for taste. We sat blindfolded with noses clamped and were fed various foods. They necessarily had little to no taste. The only discernable difference between samplings (spaced half an hour apart) was whether or not we felt the effects. We did.

Onions, garlic, carrots, herbs (such as thyme, rosemary, basil, marjoram), green pepper, celery are traditional ingredients.  But you can flavor the stock with any number of things, just depends on the flavor you want and what you are using it for.  Fish, beef, chicken and vegetable stock are easy to make and you can freeze the strained liquid into ice cube trays.  Once frozen, put the cubes in a bag and keep them in the freezer to use as needed.  Throw a cube or four into anything you want to for enhanced flavor.",

* Buy extra firm tofu for this. Freeze, thaw, then drain/press. 

* Mix up cornstarch, some poultry seasoning, cayenne, paprika, and white pepper in a shallow dish. 

* Cube drained/pressed tofu into bite-size nuggets. Drizzle with maggi and/or a sprinkle of fish sauce. Trust me, it's not going to taste fishy... just extra savory? You can use crumbled chick'n boullion (the vegan chicken seasoning in the yellow box) instead of fish sauce, but you're basically looking for some MSG to make it tasty. 

* Dredge the tofu nuggets in the seasoned cornstarch, then deep fry until golden brown and crispy. 

Boom. Tofu nuggets that you can either treat as boneless chicken wings, toss into a stir fry, use as a sandwich filler, or whatever else you want. They're so versatile and I make a batch almost every week. They even reheat well in the microwave and get crisp-chewy!

&amp;#x200B;

I'm about as lazy as they come but I'm struggling to think of others. Generally spice blends aren't good for much. You will pretty much always want/need all the component spices... and mixing them in PROPER ratio's for the specific thing your making means you'll have better flavored food for maybe 30 seconds work? Maybe look specifically for blends with MSG added... since I don't keep that around (most kitchens stock soy sauce, worchestershire, or bouquet as a MSG doser)... that'd probably give you the best results based on what it sounds like you're looking for.

  
Oh yeah, merlegerle reminded me of the Indian spice blends. That's the one exception I can think of where I saw a really good cook use blends. Indian cuisine has a bunch of blends that seem to be treated basically like western cuisine treats individual spices... but that's a whole learning experience of its own. I'm sure there's other cultures (probably many in the spice-growing regions)... but of WESTERN spice blends... most are unnecessary and inferior to just keeping a well stocked spice cabinet of pure spices.

909,"The way I learned to make fried rice from my mother (yes asian family): The secret is cold rice. Fried rice is best made with long grain rice which has been cooked in a rice cooker. You can use the rice for anything you want the day before. Refrigerate the left over rice to be used for fried rice. This cold consistency will help in the ""frying"" process of the rice, much like how frozen foods are fried to have a specific texture/consistency. For seasoning, many people like to use soy sauce, but you can shy away from the amount of actual soy sauce you add in. The addition of all this extra liquid will make the rice soggy at some point. 

Regular toppings include:
Eggs
Peas
Spam
Cha-Sieu (bbq sweet and sour pork, found in asian butcher shops/dim sum shops
Onion
Green Onion
Garlic
Anything left over (fried rice is a good dish to get rid of ingredients)

To season without the addition of too much soy sauce, we use chicken baste powder. In Asian supermarkets, it's that green cylindrical can with the yellow chicken on front. Soy sauce is good to adjust the color browning of the rice. To avoid the use of MSG in seasoning, it's best to add a small pinch of sugar to bring out the savory flavors in the food. Other than that, use a wok and OP's instructions and ta-da!

270,"I did it earlier in the week.  It was pretty good.  My friends all loved it.

A few things I learned, first go for smaller chicken breasts, and maybe if they are larger instead of butterflying them, cut them in half.  Mine were butterflied and hung over the buns quite a bit.  They also were just a  bit over cooked when the crust was done, thicker is better I think.

It also had a strong sodium taste.  I don't know if it was the salt or MSG but everyone noticed it and it was hard to eat more than one just for that reason (though we all managed to).  So I'd cut back a tad on the salt and MSG.  I know salty makes them more 'authentic' but without it it would be easier. 

Also the milk and flour mixture are more than enough to do 2 batches of chicken. 

Also, the step ""Season on all sides with remaining spice mixture"" means just pinch it and drop it on the outside as you would salt on a steak, not put the whole chicken breast into the mixture like you were dredging it like you will with the flour. ",

I find that if you tell people that what they're eating is expensive, [they tend to like it more](http://w4.stern.nyu.edu/emplibrary/jobmarket_paper_plassmann_final.pdf) . It's totally bullshit, but true. Also, try adding a bit of MSG. Seriously. Studies have shown (and I'm not sure how to link a link with a ( in it yet) http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutamic_acid_(flavor)#Research_into_health_effects (Fuck reddit links that involve a ( or a ) aka they don't work) that it doesn't actually give people headaches...they're full of shit. A good friend of mine went over to Taiwan for school and he worked in the college kitchen. He said they put more MSG into foods than salt and sugar combined and they tasted better than anything he's ever ate in america. Just don't tell anyone, they'll think you're an asshole for ""poising them."" It's all in the head for the most part if you cook a good meal. If you tell them it is more expensive than it really is, they'll think it tastes better. It's sort of like the placebo effect. The brain is a crazy thing.

Wouster goes great with beef. IMHO, this is a good idea. Woucestershire is largely about the umami, so if you want to use it some place but it brings along too many other complex flavours that don't mesh well, try some MSG for a more neutral umami.

But I think it shouldn't be weird. Tomatoes also bring umami, so really you're just boosting that a bit along with bringing some other complex flavours to the mix. But I like wouster, so I'm prejudiced in favour of this. :) Made some burger patties today - smushed them on the cold griddle, dribbled some L&amp;P on top, along with a little msg and kosher salt.

237,"I was given a bit of an insider tip on how most UK restaurants and takeaways make their rice - and it really does taste like the real deal, so will share - and (hopefully) end your frustration:

Firstly, you must always use rice that has been cooked and cooled overnight in the fridge - it will clump and stick together with freshly cooked rice.

Take your cold rice (say, 2 heaped cups for 2 people?) and put it in a bowl, add a small amount of dark soy sauce (2-3 teaspoons) - this is just for colour, then add 1/4 teaspoon of salt and (ducking for cover because Im sure this is going to generate much vitriol) - a 1/4 teaspoon of MSG.  Its the MSG that takeaways and restaurants add which is the game changer.  I was skeptical, but it DID make a difference.  Obviously I'll leave it up to you as to whether you are comfortable using it. Give it a thorough mix.

Crack an egg into another small bowl, add a tiny pinch of both salt and (cough), MSG and give it a little whisk.

Now add 2 teaspoons of vegetable oil to a preferably non-stick wok or large skillet and heat until the oil ""shimmers"" (the pan should be hot!).  Add your egg and quickly stir and move around the pan to cook - this will only take around 30 seconds.  Next add your rice and let it sit in the hot pan for, say, 20 seconds - then start stirring and mixing and flattening it with the back of your spoon to disperse any lumps.  Keep stir frying, scooping and flattening until its piping hot (about 3-4 minutes) - it will start to smell fantastic.

If you want scallions or chillis, stir fry them for about 30-40 seconds in the hot oil first, push them to one side of the pan and do your scrambled egg, then add the rice as above.

I promise this will rock your world :)

As far as ""MSG sensitivity"", it's never been reproduced in a scientific study. This is where the fear originated from:

&gt;In 1968, an American doctor wrote a letter to the New England Journal of Medicine claiming to have experience symptoms of numbness in the back of neck and a feeling of pressure in the fact and upper chest muscles, which he coined as “Chinese Restaurant Syndrome.”  He suggested this was caused by MSG because of its widespread use in Chinese restaurants, without any study, data or proof.

anchovies are a huge source of naturally occurring glutamate (the ""G"" part of MSG), that's why fish sauce tastes so savory. 

editing to expand: anything that tastes 'umami' has naturally occurring glutamates. tomatoes, cheese, a lot of fish, meats, seaweed, a lot of aged or fermented things. the glutamates that form in these foods are literally identical to what your body breaks MSG down into (monosodium glutamate=sodium+glutamate).

Now, place a tspn of filling in dumpling skin and wrap. Use water to seal the edges if necesarry. I'm not really able to show you how to wrap to get the nice wrinkled effect but as long as you get the entire thing sealed you'll be fine. 

Fry on high heat one side until golden. Then flip over. Add a little water and cover for 5 min on low heat. Hopefully you did not add too much water (else you end up with soggy dumplings). Remove the lid and cook until all the water has evaporated. 

Note: You can freeze the dumplings for later. No need to defrost. Just steam for longer! :D

Also, it's not a website but one book I highly recommend as an introduction into Chinese Cooking is *The Chinese Kitchen* by Deh-ta Hsiung. It basically covers most of the ingredients used in Chinese/Taiwanese cooking as well as most of the popular recipes. 

One of the things it explains is the sauces we use ie. Soy sauce. In chinese, the more accurate translation would be Soy Oil 酱油. Which explained to me at least, why growing up I'd get confused when my mum would tell me to pass her the 酱油 and I'd go looking for the sesame oil. My poor mum. For the longest time she thought she'd raised a slow child and had given up on me ever being able to survive on my own xD. 

Anyway, happy cooking!

The basics of Chinese is a hot wok, gas fired is best.  Oil - it HAS to be near smoking point.  Are you using canola or peanut?  Lots of Chinese restaurants use peanut because of the higher smoking point.  Soggy vegetables?  You're cooking it too long and/or the julienne might be not thin enough.

Frying?  Use canola if you have to, peanut is better.

Sauces are typically made at the end, pull your food out of the wok, remove excess oil and build the sauce immediately.  After your sauce is done, add the food back in to coat and serve immediately.  Chinese food is meant to be eaten right after it comes out of the wok, so timing is important.

The only problem is, infants don't have a fully developed blood brain barrier yet, which is a very important consideration.

MSG doesn't cause any problems or even stir concern when it is added as ""hydrolysed vegetable protein, soy sauce, fish sauce, hydolysed yeast extract, yeast extract"" The truth is people have no idea what they are talking about, and MSG sounds 'chemically' to them so they act irrationally.

I have found that it can enhance any protein if used correctly, it kicks beef up a notch for sure. Just don't overdue it. It goes particularly well with  browned meats and beans. 

Anything savory with lots of protein will be suited for MSG. I like to think about it this way: glutamate is the salt of the amino acid glutamine. As proteins break down during fermentation or cooking MSG and glutamine occur naturally. If it occurs naturally, then adding more will probably take it up a notch. 

Don't forget fish sauce and soy sauce are goods sources of MSG.. Don't be afraid of yeast extract either...

Try to pinpoint foods that have MSG as a key component to gain a better understanding of what flavors will work with it then branch out and do your thing... Doritoes, Ranch Dressing, Ramen noodles etc...",
860,"MSG. Yea, that shit works.",
826,"Technically his equivalency is a bit off, but the fact remains that MSG is made of sodium and glutamate which are both naturally occurring in many foods.  Therefore, judicious use is no different than adding in a glutamate rich food and some salt.

However, he is wrong about the exact equivalency he gave.  The number of grams of a substance cannot be taken directly from a pseudo-volume measure like a teaspoon, but most sources claim a tsp = 3-6 grams so we'll say a 1/2 tsp = 2 grams in this example.  [This](http://www.umamiinfo.com/2011/03/umami-rich-food-vegetables.php/) source has glutamate from tomatoes at 250mg/100g of tomato and [this](http://www.tomatom.com/2008/12/are-you-a-happy-little-glutamate/) source has it at 150 mg/100 g.  So for the sake of this example we will use 200 mg of glutamate /100 g of tomato.

So how much glutamate do we need to get the equivalent of 1/2 tsp worth of MSG?  Glutamate has a molar mass of 147 g/mol and sodium's is 23 g/mol.  Thus glutamate is 86% of the mass of MSG (147/170x100).  At 2 grams of MSG in a teaspoon, we need 1.7 g of glutamate (2x86%/100%).  According to our source of 200 mg of glutamate/ 100 g of tomato we need just under a kilo of tomatoes (850 g) to get the necessary glutamate.  This would probably be more like 4 large tomatoes according to [this](http://nutritiondata.self.com/facts/vegetables-and-vegetable-products/2682/2).  Also you would be adding less sodium than 1/2 tsp of salt because MSG is only 14% sodium while table salt is 40% sodium.  So, while the example was technically wrong its message still is correct.

Thus, I think you should begin by learning classic techniques and the ideas behind them. I believe the reason I am a better cook of Japanese food than her mom is that I know how to make Chinese dishes, she does not.

I was fortunate to have a lot of talented people teach me a lot of things. Following a recipe isn't enough. You need to learn ""why"" as well. For an example - why do you use a round-bottom wok? Because you use less oil. Dishes don't come out the same with more oil. 

Another example: people here have talked about fried rice. I haven't read any of their links - generally I don't bother because I know it's a straight Western step-by-step recipe. They don't tell you the key, which is day-old rice. Fresh rice is too moist and sticky. Will it tell you why you must use a long grain rice? Westerners just think ""oh, I'll substitute x for y"" - no, it doesn't work like that. If you use the wrong kind of rice, it won't stir fry. You need to use sesame oil in the wok and a tiny bit of fat/lard. It takes high heat and presents a certain flavour authentic to fried rice. Do you add soy sauce? Why or why not? Generally you add some salt AND MSG for a restaurant-like taste. 

Do they tell you that you remove and set aside things and add them again? That you blanch or cook the vegetables first, then remove them? That you then scramble the egg in the wok with a little oil and remove it? Then you quickly cook the rice, careful to never let it linger over the direct heat and add your veggies and egg afterward?

See, you won't know this unless you actually have it explained to you because you'll skip steps. Look for the why - the how will happen. I can usually replicate a dish I've never had because I know the why.

I don't mind MSG, though I think it's basically a way to make processed/crappy foods cheaply. But I'm allergic to it, so more than a little bit and I get asthma. I'm pretty much over my asthma as I outgrew it, but the last two times as an adult that I've had to get an adrenalin shot in hospital was because of MSG.

I think it's risky to put in food you serve others. I don't cook with peanut oil for friends, for an example.

One thing I disagree with is that MSG offers a more intense flavour. If you're using crappy, iodized salt, sure. But if you're actually putting quality, care and love into your cooking, you're using kosher salt at worst and fleur de sel at best. If you want your reputation to get better, why use an additive that is known for making $0.37 burritos at Walmart be able to be that cheap when you could use the best?

If you want to talk about complex flavours, try sea salt from Scotland, Hawaii or France.

The question you've posed is like saying ""People really love my homemade mac and cheese that I use aged gouda and cheddar in. How can I make it better by using Velveeta?"" You don't. You just add gelatin to the recipe.

That's exactly it. The sodium content of MSG is high and people tend to use way more of it than they should. You can always tell processed foods that have MSG before you read the ingredients by the sodium content...and of course they never use MSG as the description, either.

If we didn't all eat crappy iodized salt and instead used kosher salt or fleur de sel, MSG wouldn't even be an issue. MSG is good because it's inexpensive for mass-produced food. For home cooking? Sea and clay salts give you a lot more than MSG can.

 ____NEXT COMMENT____ 
If you ever go into authentic Chinese restaurants, they often have disclaimers about allergies. I've outgrown my asthma, but one thing can give me an asthma attack and that's too much MSG in a meal.

The only thing more perplexing to me than the militant anti-MSG folk are the militant pro-MSG folk such as yourself.

It really is a moot point for seasoning. If you asked a decent chef the difference between that and fleur de sel, especially the clay salt they have in Okinawa, they will tell you there is a huge difference and they are right.

The problem with your thesis is that if you cook the same Asian dishes you're talking about, except with a very good salt, you'll find the same umami sensation. It's why you put salt in chocolate chip cookies. It's about understanding balance.

MSG requires no skill, understanding and applying seasoning does. And the reason your friend likes the taste more is that our mineral salt is not very good and we don't use a lot of seasonings. You might use white pepper, black pepper, fivespice, msg and salt in an Asian dish all at once. It's not that MSG is better, it's that things are seasoned differently there. We are a neophyte culture when it comes to seasoning.

IMO, MSG should mainly be used with pork and beef when you are pairing it with a sweet sauce. Everything else benefits from proper seasoning and a decent sea salt. I use MSG when I am lazy.

 ____NEXT COMMENT____ 
There are some good ideas here. With seasonings, you've got mustard, nutmeg and my favourite, paprika...mix the mustard, but top with the paprika and nutmeg, then...

Panko. Saute it in butter first, then broil it. You don't want to burn the mac and Panko doesn't just broil instantly. Also, I don't use straight panko, but I also use lightly toasted/dried and roughly grated Italian bread.

Pasta. Rigati is the way to go because it holds the sauce. I love to use this:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cavatappi

Make sure you get one that is rigati, aka *ridged* on the outside.

You can also buy no 5 or no 6 macaroni, cook it and then cut it yourself to be longer. Make sure you toss your noodles in butter after you cook them.

I disagree with using any sort of cheese that is above a medium cheddar in your sauce. It's far too oily. You should, however, put a layer of coarsely grated sharp or extra sharp cheddar on top, then seasonings, then breadcrumbs. I also use emmenthal or gruyere in there, but I prefer emmenthal because it's drier. Gruyere is gooier.

I also like to eliminate as much salt as possible and use grana padano, reggiano, etc. This is a very important secret. They contain a sort of ""natural MSG"", which is their saltiness, but also how they amplify other flavours. 

Also, let's not forget to use full 35% cream. Someone mentioned carrageen. Guess what has that? Most crappy 35% cream that isn't organic. Guess what helps you with your cheese? That.

See, I'm sort of against the roux and the flour. The less you use the better. Thick cream with carrageen? Less flour. That poster is correct. This is why you have to buy 35% cream...besides the fact it's awesome.

And speaking of roux, if you get some Annie's or another boxed mac that has powdered cheese, use it instead of flour. It still accomplishes the same thing as flour. That really is the secret ingredient.

jarred sauces often have variant-forms of msg in them as a preservative, which may be one reason why they seem to taste better.

just in case blown-out taste buds aren't in question, here's the recipe for my grandmother's sauce, improved upon by myself after 7 years of making it:

1 lg. can (32 oz?) of whole or diced tomatoes. i like ""6 in 1"" brand if you can find it.
1 med/16oz can diced tomatoes
1-2 sm/8oz cans tomato paste (depending on how thick/thin you want your sauce)
8-16oz of water, again, depending on your consistency preferences and how long you plan to cook the sauce

1 head of garlic, minced
1/2-1 lg. white onion, diced
a large handful of dried basil
salt, pepper, paprika and cayenne to taste
a pinch or two of sugar, to cut the acidity of the tomatoes

brown onion and garlic in some olive oil at the bottom of a large pot
add all tomato products and water (you want a fair amount of surplus liquid because it cooks down)
stir in all your spices
let simmer for 2-4 hours at med-low heat

for extra-good flavor buy a pack of spicy italian sausages. brown them when you brown the onion/garlic and let simmer with the sauce. makes it extra oily/tasty.

should make enough to serve with a box of good pasta (tinkyada pasta joy, anyone?) and have a jar to spare for use in the next week.

No statistical association has been demonstrated under controlled conditions, even in studies with people convinced that they are sensitive to it.**""

In other words, ""People say it affects them badly, we tested it, and can't reproduce results to confirm this, and any individual test results which showed positive both fall below minimum statistical error, and when those individuals get retested, (often multiple times), the results show that the test which showed sensitivity was completely irreproducible.

There are some bone broth companies, usually locally made boutique kind of shops or there's a home delivery one I think. The easiest way I've found to do it is a crock pot. You just need to roast the bones first. If it's a chicken or turkey that was roasted, already done. Then you can just toss in the Crock-Pot full of water for 8-12hrs on low and there you have it. Season to your taste. For beef you want to boil the bones for 10min first and toss out the water, this prevents scum that clouds the broth. Then roast. Then again into the crock pot. probably easier than it sounds. I actually just use a pot, the key with all broth to keeping in clear is to never actually boil the broth, juts a good summer. You get a delicious amber colour that way. It takes a little attn at the start to get it up to temp without going to a boil and keeping it hot enough to stay at a simmer, but once you find the sweet spot you can pretty much leave it alone for all day. Then you strain it and refrigerate overnight night. Last step take the hardened fat off the top. Then you can scoop the gelatin into mugs and microwave.

What? MSG is frequently touted as adding an umami sensation to food. The umami sensation is caused by the carboxylate anion of glutamate on the tongue. This happens very strongly when MSG (monosodium **glutamate**) dissolves in our saliva.

There's nothing bad about MSG. It's like being wary of milk when you're not lactose intolerant. MSG has been repeatedly shown to be safe for consumption and there is nothing but weak anecdotal evidence that there's anything dangerous about it. Keep in mind that ""natural"" and ""organic"" have nothing to do with how safe something is for you. ",
381,"The paper discusses the possible genetic predisposition either for the production of MTDH, which ""possibly"" downregulates EAAT2 (the major coder for the glutamate transporter to the brain), or the upregulation of PGCP, which is a precursor for GCPII, which breaks down NAAG into glutamate + NAA for use various bodily functions, including the nervous system.

I was unable to find any papers as to whether or not the glutamate produced from the breakdown of MSG is involved in the production of NAAG, or at least at producing NAAG at high enough levels into the neurological pathways to be considered bad.  Also, it is unclear as to whether or not glutamic acid itself crosses the blood-brain barrier at level that is considered dangerous (I guess it's possible that they didn't consider people with this possible condition).  So, even if you *do* have the disorder, it is up in the air as to whether or not the ingestion of MSG is actually the culprit (sorry that your anecdote doesn't persuade me otherwise).  Human bodies produce glutamate themselves, and it is possible that your own body will produce excess glutamate at times, perhaps in reaction to some other stimulus, causing migraine.

[this article says it's uncertain as to where the glutamate comes from in the intro](http://www.jbc.org/content/272/17/11276.full), however, it is possible that it comes from MSG.  This article *is* from 1997, but that doesn't make it automatically wrong.

That's the sodium part of monosodium glutamate you're tasting, overwhelming the impulse created by the glutamate receptor.  MSG is literally comprised of just sodium and glutamate.  We call the savory receptor on the tongue ""umami"" because it wasn't discovered until relatively recently, and we just adopted the term from the Japanese lexicon.  Up until then we didn't know savory had its own taste receptor.  This savory ""umami"" receptor on the tongue is biochemically a glutamate receptor.

594,"Hi Everr,

I was lucky enough to take extensive lessons when i was in Koh Samui in Thai cookery -I cook Thai curry at least once a week, I think i can help you!

First,I don't know where you are based but if in London,Taj Stores in Brick Lane is the bizz for ALL Asian/indian specialities, for specific Thai stores, you need to go to Chinatown and check out New Loon Moon or See Wo.

If you aren't in London may I suggest www.thai-food-online.co.uk?
You should have no problem finding Kaffir Lime leaves -be aware they are often frozen, doesn't make any difference and much easier to use they keep forever in the freezer, lemongrass sticks freeze really well too.

You should also have no trouble finding Thai basil, often known as holy basil(no idea why!) obviously doesn't freeze as well - you can also grow it yourself very easily- check out Jekka's herb farm in the UK - very good mail order service.

I can't actually recommend a good Thai commercial curry paste -I really can't! they all taste of preservatives and chemicals and they are shit- but...All the Thai supermarkets suggested will have their own Thai home made curry pastes in the fridge, just ask, they are fabulous but only last a week refrigerated!

Fish sauce, I tend to use whatever is most readily available, but always ask the assistant what they recommend, generally the more expensive the better, it'll still be cheap as chips!

As to the two sauces, if one was fish sauce, they other will be Tamarind paste, the way to finish a Thai curry-available everywhere that I have suggested.

The two white substances? one definitely sugar, usually palm sugar and the other .. I'm pretty certain MSG powder! You do NOT need to add this but if you want to you can find it at above recommendations!

Really DON'T be scared of making your own curry paste, as I said I make it at least once a week, it takes me 25 mins to cook a curry, if I use a food processor, slightly longer if I use a pestle and mortar.

I have to run right now but if you are interested, I have great fail safe recipes for green Thai curry paste  but also red and the best !!!!! yellow, which will make you swoon!

I'm just in the process of putting my food blog together, I cook Sri Lankan( spent a long time in Sri Lankan Kitchens learning!) ,Thai and Indonesian(Beef Rendang!) and some Indian curries every week -They are really easy-with the right ingredients! Delicious and QUICK to make.I'm just putting together recipes and instructional videos -if you are interested please let me know.

I can tell you from experience that that is not true. I end up with a giant headache if I eat food with MSG. I can definitely tell if a food has MSG. I end up with a blinding pulsating headache. This is how I found out Doritos have MSG! Ate a bag, got a headache, checked the ingredients, bam MSG.

Yeah, as a scientist I do know what blinded means. I also know that correlation does not imply causation. I was just making a comment that MSG does give some people migraines. Additionally, many of the studies I have seen have used healthy participants, which would mean people who generally don't get migraines to begin with.

78,"Yes I’m so sorry for the late reply!! 

For the brisket, it sounds weird but I swear just try it. 

Mix oyster sauce with yellow mustard, a small amount of msg and chicken bouillon, (and any other spices you enjoy for example I’ll add garlic and onion powder), coat raw brisket with it and broil the whole thing until it’s crispy on the outside and still a little red on the inside, flip it halfway through, you’ll know it’s ready to be flipped when the side facing up has gotten a nice crisp with a little bit of blackening, (or a lot of you roll that way). Slice it thinly and serve with sticky rice (or just regular rice) and papaya salad. 

I normally mix a little less oyster sauce in than mustard. And the bouillon is just to taste, (though use a little more than you think you should)
Don’t do the coating too thick or it won’t crisp correctly, and I usually marinate the whole thing overnight in the fridge. Oh and the raw brisket should be trimmed down to be somewhat uniform (it doesn’t have to be anywhere near perfect). 
It’s one of the strangest recipes I’ve ever come across but it’s so good. 

Lately I’ve been trying to nail the recipie down with exact measurements but it’s literally so simple. I was never told exact measurements, I just stole the recipie by watching what she took out of the fridge and cabinet so I swear y’all can do it too!! 

And if you do end up trying it please tell me if you liked it! I’d love to hear about more people discovering the dish, or little changes you’ve made to it  :)


As for green papaya salad, I tend to make the more basic version because I like it more without all the accoutrements, (like the little crabs and other things). 

You just shred or chop semi-thin one unripe, hard, green papaya. Smash a couple Thai chili’s until they’re absolutely pulverized, (a mortar and pestle really helps here, and these things may be small but some of them can be ridiculously spicy). Add a few cherry tomatoes (my SIL and MIL like to crush these lightly and they’re actually from Laos so I assume that’s traditional but I prefer them whole). Squeeze in lime juice to taste, (it shouldn’t be too sour but don’t worry because a little sugar can fix it if you add too much) and my in laws all swear you have to add msg as well. After that mix it all up in your bowl with a generous splash of padaek, (Laotian fish sauce). It HAS to be padaek! Papaya salad just doesn’t taste half as good without it. 

I hope you all try one or both of these and tell me about it! :) and that I didn’t ramble on too long, and that my psa about msg isn’t too annoying lol. 


(I swear most of the msg fear was founded in racism, (the same type that once claimed garlic was harmful!) it’s all just part of the U.S.’s long history of viewing the “exotic” cuisine of Asia as dangerous or dirty. Nowadays that asian food is all the rage it seems to be lack of knowledge.  I understand some people are still terrified of it but I urge you to educate yourselves on the ingredient  because it is to savory what sugar is to sweet and salt is to salty)",

MSG. It's a wonderful tenderizer and has great flavor.

I looked it up again. The number cited was actually less than 1%. But they claim it just causes headaches from meals with lots of msg (asian products normally have much more). It's absolutely not dangerous in any ways and there's absolutely no proof of any effects that it causes except that it may cause headaches and muscle tightness in less than 1% of the population. Some people do just get headaches from certain foods, it doesn't mean it's bad for you. If someone says it makes them feel headachey I would believe them, but it happens to so few people I wouldn't even worry about it. If they get a headache after the fact without telling them remember not to serve them msg again.

Depends a lot on the other ingredients in there and how much they already deliver. Soup for two might be a pinch to a quarter teaspoon. A tomato soup for example ready has a lot of umami so less addition if any is needed.

As long as you're a home cook, your ""level"" will be hard to quantify. I'm not a professional cook but I'm damn good at say, a ragu, while I'm close to clueless at things like schnitzels and until recently, boiling rice. 

&amp;#x200B;

The two things that made me feel that I improved as a cook were A. focusing on a particular type of cooking (e.g. pasta and sauces) and B. diversifying my repertoire. Ever since I got into Chinese cooking I learned the value of (naturally occurring) MSG and the Maillard reaction and I keep that knowledge in mind even when I'm not cooking things that call for easy MSG sources such as soy sauce or fish sauce.

There's also a C. that I've been working on but don't master yet - cucina povera/peasant's food.

It forces you to pay attention to detail and technique and helps reveal your flaws as a cook.

Was about to suggest cooking it in rendered fat, but looks like you got that. You could add some coriander powder, paprika or some other spices that can add background flavour without changing the taste you want.

Umami is basically MSG/monosodium glutamate, which makes food tasty/savoury. A correct amount of salt/sodium chloride also enhances the taste of food, so there must be some link between sodium and tastiness.  

You may hear a lot of things about soy sauce or fish sauce, but you can get the umami taste from things like aged cheese, ripe tomatoes or even browning your meat (which is why seared meat tastes better than boiled - it's called the Maillard reaction). ",

 ____NEXT COMMENT____ 
It really depends on your concept of healthy and easy is.

I feel that stir fries, as long as they don't use a ton of oil and thickened sauce is healthy.  I feel easy is something that I can cook &lt;15min.

For something less Asian-ish: oil, garlic, green leafy veg, a little water, salt, ajinomoto/msg(if you're okay with that sort of thing).  Protein frying in another pan.  If you're okay with waiting a little longer, you could wait till your protein is done and cook your veggies in there.  Something like chicken with spinach(you could add mushrooms, tomato, shallots).

That is pretty much the quickest way to go about things.  Steaming/boiling/baking take significantly more time, but less immediate attention.  Another good option is to just make a batch of something, like Japanese curry, and reheat it during the week.  Basically anything braised/stewed is a good choice.  Even if you only have a braised protein that needs reheating, it'll save you time and energy when you need it most.  Once you have a braised protein, all you need to do is saute some veggies.

I know you specifically asked for dishes, but you can do a ton with just one technique.

salt, acid, sweetness, fat, piquancy, and umami will make your food good if you can balance them correctly.  If something tastes bland, it's usually just missing salt.  If you feel like your dish is missing something, it tends to be acid.

I scramble my **egg** first, with **kosher salt** and **black pepper**, put it aside.

For meat, I usually use what I have on hand. I have used chicken breast, pork sirloin, ribeye. I cook everything for the fried rice in my cast iron pan. Salt and black pepper, then sear the **meat** on both sides, put aside. (As long as I have my sear, I don't worry much about doneness, the meat will cook more when it goes back in the rice.)

Mince **garlic** and **onions**. Chop **Chinese  sausage** small. Chop **carrots** thinly. **Chop green onions**. Chop meat to bite size, now that it has rested.

Heat pan to medium high heat. Add **oil**. Fried rice needs alot of oil to be really good, remember you are frying it. I usually use **canola or vegetable.** There may be a more appropriate oil, but I keep these on hand, and fried rice is usually a spur of the moment thing for me. 


 
Add chinese sausage (provides extra grease to cook veggies).
Add carrots.
Add garlic and onion. 
In that order.
Add a little **butter**.
Once butter is melting add **rice**.  If you are adding a lot of rice you may need to turn your heat up, you want to maintain temperature.

Add **oyster sauce**.
Add **sweet soy sauce**.
Add a dash of **dark mushroom soy sauc**e.(Mostly for color, I like my fried rice dark.)

Stir vigorously enough to make sure your rice doesn't stick. You want your pan hot, but you don't want sticking rice, there is a fine line. While sauteing rice, add salt, black pepper, **white pepper,** **chinese red pepper**, **msg**(probably about 1/5 or even less the amount of salt you use), add your meat back, egg next, then green onions to finish.

Alot of people finish with sesame oil, I don't. Preference. Also, saw someone else mention lime juice, I might try that, I haven't thought about altering the acidity of my fried rice yet. I might try to deglaze the meat with a little rice vinegar, and pour it out of the pan with the meat while it rests.

WHAT.  No. No no no no no.  NO ONE touches the food while it's being prepared unless they are cleared by me or my partner. We have a whole rack of knives on the wall as a warning to anyone who would try that.  (Of course, I'm lucky to live away from family, so that common source of meddling isn't here)

You are NOT a monster.  You have been stuck cooking for assholes.  I'm sorry your family sucks - you don't need to cook for them ever, especially if they won't try foods their family member made and will mess with your food as it's cooking.  You don't need to cook for anyone if you don't want to, and you DEFINITELY are not obligated to alter your cooking to accommodate someone in your house (who isn't someone you specifically want to be there).  

That said, if you WANT to host a dinner for people (who aren't jackasses), it is definitely courteous and appropriate to account for food restrictions that are medical or religious in nature, or to at least let them know what will be in the food that may be an issue for them.  But if that isn't working for you, it is entirely okay to order out, eat out, or do a potluck that is more relaxed and less pressure on you.  

You deserve to find people who will appreciate interesting cooking and who will respect your kitchen.  They are out there, but it may take time to find them.  Until then, cook for you.

I don't use MSG as usually sold in the granulated form, but I do make generous use of umami / glutamic sources from food ingredients like miso, kombu, tomatoes, onions, seared meats, fish sauce, anchovies, etc.  There should be glutamic acid sources in food so it's savory and tasty, but the exact source is open based on your preference (and budget). 

Unless you don't eat any prepackaged food like chips, cured meats, frozen foods, canned foods, etc. then you are already consuming lots of MSG.  

 ____NEXT COMMENT____ 
Pretty much anything that is processed and that is ""savory"" has it. The stereotype that American-Chinese restaurants use it inaccurately implies that others don't; every fast food place uses it in some form.

Since there are lots of natural sources of glutamic acid - tomatoes, aged cheese, anchovies, miso, soy sauce, yeast/hydrolyzed yeast extract - using MSG specifically in its granular form is going to be better if someone can't consume one of those ingredients, or if texture/hydration is an issue or you want to only have one or two specific flavors (like on Doritos chips). Otherwise, the above ingredients, often as they are listed in good recipes, provide plenty of glutamic acid as well as other flavors.

Transfer to a casserole dish and sprinkle with grated cheese (some breadcrumbs are good too). Then grill.

Instead of pasta, steam some cauliflower (don't boil as it becomes waterlogged), and use instead for a classic cauliflower cheese. Broccoli works too!",

Oh, and MSG. ",
876,umani is a flavor brought on by glutamate acids (think msg)  its common in fish sauces where the glutamaic acids can be converted. ,
96,"There it goes: 

Step 1: dough

Ingredients:
1/2 kg of flour
1 glass of warm water (~200ml)
1 tablespoon of salt
~ 30-40g of butter (80%+ fat content) - margarine is a big no-no
1 egg

Spare flour to flour board/bowl you're mixing it on/in.

The dough:

Mix flour with salt, add egg and while mixing egg in gradually add water and butter. Knead it into smooth texture (should take 8-10 mins) roll it into semi thick tube shape (think of it like really thick worm) and cut it with floured knife into 4-5 segments. Cover it with cling film or aluminium foul and let it rest for 10-15 mins (don't leave any part exposed to air to not dry dough).

Flour the board and roll a segment to about 4-5mm thick piece. Use glass (can be same as you had water in), dip it in flour and cut round shapes (wider the glass, bigger the pierogi will be). 

Do it just before putting filling in as dough will be drying and becoming crumbly on outside. 


Part 2: Filling

This is the part you can go WILD. 
As long as filling is not too soggy you are limited by imagination. I'll give you example of traditional one from Poland and some ideas but this part is up to you! 

Potatoes and curd cheese filling - aka pierogi ""ruskie"" :

Ingredients:
1/2 kg of mashed potatoes (fresh, lightly warm, no additions) - frozen won't cut it
125-150g of curd cheese (drained)
1 medium to large onion (depends on your liking to onions) - chop it
Bit of salt and pepper (freshly grinded)

The filling:

Start with mixing potatoes with curd cheese adding salt and pepper mixing it like a dough.
On a pan melt butter and drop of oil (to stop butter from burning) and add chopped onions, add pinch of salt and fry till golden/light brown.
Add fried onions to filling you already mixed and mix again. Done.

Other ideas can be : lightly fried minced meat (with salt, peper and garlic), curry, or even fruit (blueberries!, part crushed, part whole, yum! With sweet cream/whipped cream). Just remember, nothing too soggy/watery.

Part 3: The Pierogi.

Now that you have filling and dough it's time to get serious.
Prepare bit of water in advance (50ml will be more than enough) and put your dough circle on your hand flat, add roughly teaspoon of filling in middle and fold it over into kind of crecent shape. Before sealing it, strech edges a bit and dip finger in water to use it as a glue for dough (just the very edges of your dough circle). After you put edges together, give them a pinch around edges to make sure filling is sealed inside. That takes bit of practice, but you'll make it perfect after some time. 

After making your bunch, you can or make more of pierogi or move on to cooking them. If you want to leave them before cooking whole bunch at once, cover them with cloth to slow down drying of dough. 

Part 4: Cooking pierogi and extras:

Boil water with bit of salt and 2-3 spoons of oil (oil is to prevent pierogi sticking to eachother).
When water is boiling, put enough of them inside to be able to stir them. Don't overload pan with pierogi! It will be disastrous. And don't forget to stir them around so they don't stick to bottom.
After about 5mins they should start floating, give them another 2 mins after most are floating and take them out and drain. If they get too sticky in yoir drainer, add bit more oil to water. 
They are ready to go after cooling down!
You can also fry them after draining to light brown colour, even put bit of spices while frying.

As of extras, if you went with traditional recipe i gave you i recommend serving them with one of following:
Sour cream
Pork belly cut into cubes and fried until crispy (put it on a plate with some of that oil!)
Melted butter or lard(if you have home made available or from butchers).
Any souce like mushroom, gravy, etc will go nicely with it as well. 

If you need any more advice, meal ideas from polish cusine or something not clear about recipe, msg me or post here.

Enjoy!

837,"There is no such thing. Unless this ""bonding agent"" refers to contamination (which is worthy of food supply chain investigation), MSG is just a type of salt (technical term salt rather than table salt).

The article linked is abject pseudoscience which separates naturally occuring glutamate from MSG because somehow being attached to sodium changes things. Any first year university chemistry student (hell, even high school chem students) can tell you that when a salt is dissolved (e.g. in saliva or during digestion) you get glutamate back in it's  original ionic form, identical to naturally occuring glutamate).

There are no good quality ""studies"" done on the subject showing effect; the one in the article is typical of RCTs where MSG ""challenge"" given are massively excessive. The sodium in MSG itself is enough to cause an effect. Imagine if you take in several times your recommended daily salt intake in one go or in one meal. Won't you feel dehydrated, palpitations, headaches, etc? The studies often fail to control the fact that if you're avoiding MSG and glutamate rich foods, you tend to favour less fatty, less salty foods and more fibre in diet; is it any surprise at all that a healthy diet makes people feel better? Or that after a night of asian food that was probably cooked in a good amount of fat, wine, and salt it's not really surprising you feel a little bloated?

Most of this started as racism but it seems the pseudoscientific ""chemicals are bad"" camp has caught on. The most harmful part of MSG is probably the sodium, and excessive amounts of sodium is bad for your health regardless of where it came from, whether it's monosodium glutamate or sodium chloride (table salt).",

It's always pickle juice and a few other random spices that absolutely will not duplicate the flavor.

 ____NEXT COMMENT____ 
The spices may be somewhat similar (though I kinda doubt it) but I can see two big problems:

First, the cooking method will absolutely not produce the same results.  KFC chicken is cooked in a pressure fryer which gives the coating that soft texture that KFC is known for.  The recipe here would produce a crisp, crunchy crust.

Second, KFC's seasoning contains MSG which enhances other flavors.  It's not something you can eliminate from a recipe and get the same results.

 ____NEXT COMMENT____ 
The recipes all appear to be wrong.  Some wildly wrong.

The A1 Steak Sauce recipe doesn't contain tomato puree, which is the first ingredient on the label.  That's going to make a difference in the taste.

The Baby Ruth recipe contains 1 cup of peanuts and 8 cups of oatmeal?  WTF?  There's no oatmeal in a Baby Ruth, much less eight times as much as there are peanuts.

Wheat Thins get part of their flavor from malt syrup, which isn't in the recipe given.

Chips Ahoy don't contain eggs.  The recipe given does, which would give the cookies a much different texture and flavor.

Kraft Macaroni and Cheese uses a cheese powder that doesn't contain the fat of regular cheese.  The fat is replaced in the recipe with butter, which creates a not-entirely-real-cheese flavor.  The given recipe contains no butter because normal cheese (if you're willng to call Cheez Whiz normal), which would give a different flavor and texture.

The Starbucks Frappuccino recipe somehow doesn't include ice.  Ice is a major ingredient in the drink.

The Chik-Fil-A sandwich recipe is missing MSG and paprika.  The coating mix uses plain flour while Chick-Fil-A adds barley flour.  The recipe also suggests using your pressure cooker as a pressure fryer, which isn't a good idea since the seals aren't generally designed to withstand the higher temperatures that oil reaches.  If you're going to try pressure frying, you need to use a pressure fryer that's designed for the job.

Wendy's chili uses green bell peppers, not green chilis.  I can't imagine anyone mistaking one for the other.

The Reese's cup recipe says to use regular peanut butter in the center, but the peanut butter in a Reese's cups adds sugar and doesn't add extra oil (that's why it's crumbly and not spreadable like regular peanut butter).  The texture and flavor of regular peanut butter won't come close to being the same.

KFC doesn't taste remotely like Italian dressing mix mixed with tomato soup mix.  It's also deep fried in a pressure cooker, which has a huge impact on the taste and texture.  Frying it in 1/2 inch of oil in a skillet wouldn't turn out remotely close to the same.

Nutri-grain bars.  A Nutri-grain bar contains 3 grams of fat and is made with a mix of plain flour, whole wheat flour and wheat bran.  The recipe calls for *a box of yellow cake mix, some oats and 3/4 cup of butter* for the coating.  Aside from sounding horribly dry and gross, it wouldn't taste even remotely the same.  This is even sillier than pretending KFC tastes like Italian dressing. 

 ____NEXT COMMENT____ 
This recipe has been floating around on the internet for years and, while it might taste good, it's not going to taste like Chick-Fil-A's nuggets.  For one thing, there's no sugar and that's what lends the sweetness to Chick-Fil-A's products.

You can see the real ingredient list [here](http://www.chick-fil-a.com/Food/Menu-Detail/ChickfilA-Nuggets#?details=ingredients), but basically it's:

Chicken breast  
seasoning (salt, monosodium glutamate, sugar, spices, paprika)  
Milk wash (water, egg, nonfat milk)  
seasoned coating (flour, sugar, salt, monosodium glutamate, nonfat milk, baking soda, spice, soybean oil, paprika)

Any recipe that doesn't include those ingredients, particularly the MSG and sugar, is not going to taste like what Chick-Fil-A sells.

And don't even get me started on the stupid rumor that they supposedly marinate their chicken in pickle juice.  I had a GF who read that and decided to try the recipe that was given.  Suffice to say that chicken marinated in pickle juice is pretty nasty.  Even the dog refused to eat it.


 ____NEXT COMMENT____ 
No it's not.  [The list the ingredients on their site](http://www.chick-fil-a.com/Food/Menu-Detail/ChickfilA-Chicken-Sandwich#?details=ingredients).  No pickle juice.  No vinegar.  Nothing of the sort.

The only reason their sandwiches have a pickle flavor to them is because THEY PUT PICKLES ON THEM.  Marinating your chicken in pickle juice will not duplicate the flavor of Chick-Fil-A's chicken.  When you see a clone recipe that calls for pickle juice, it's wrong.  If it leaves out sugar and MSG, it's also wrong since those are two of the more distinctive flavors that their chicken has.

Roughly chop two pints of mushrooms, and sweat them with a heavy pinch of salt in a skillet with a small amount of oil over medium, or medium low heat.  When they have reduced in volume by half, put them in a food processor with 1/2 cup of bread crumbs and one egg, pulse until it is relatively homogeneous, but not a paste, about 3 or 4 1-second pulses.

In experimentation, try adding onion and garlic to the initial sweat, but make sure they're well-minced so you don't want to water-log the mixture.

Great choice to add MSG; it's too bad it has the stigma it does.  How much of what cut of pork?  16 minutes is a a lot of frying time for thin strips instead of chunks.

If you want it to be like a restaurant, you might consider frying the pork in a more hearty breading  than a dusting of flour (chicken-fried style, velveted, or tempura could work) and pouring the sauce/chutney over the rice and pork at or *just prior* to service to keep it crispy.

It's the same way that carab or hazelnut or whatever else cant really replace chocolate if that's what you want.

So the best advice is to simply change your mindset.  You're not looking for ingredients that you substitute in for meat, you're not looking for meals that replace meat options.  What you're looking for by and large are delicious meals that happen to not include meat.  And at the same time don't think of this as a healthier or better diet, instead think of it as a lifestyle change.

Now some more specific general advice:

Simply reducing portions of meat is always simple.  If you'd normally add 8 punces of chicken per person to a stir fry cut that down to 4 or even 2 ounces.  If you're out to eat picking a vegetarian main but a meat starter is a great way to indulge without having to go for that 16 oz T bone.  Meat free days are good if you need more firm goals.  Using the most of whatever meat you buy is great too.  Making stock from leftover bones is a fantastic way to get more meat flavor without more meat.  

And some more specific advice.  Indian cooking in general is a great direction to go.  There are tons of great Indian dishes that are meant to be vegetarian, and when done right it never feels like meat is missing or being replaced by something.  Beans and rice are a great way to get your protein, and there are so many different takes on it.

Meat tends to cover the umami flavor in a dish, but mushrooms, Worcestershire, Parmesan, or straight up MSG can cover that base (along with many other ingredients).",

You are using 5 individuals as the basis for your discussion. You didn't reference the findings of the study, only your family. Also, with the protocol of picking foods containing MSG I simply assumed this to be a DIY job in your kitchen. So that's why 'the fuck' I'm assuming as such. 

 ____NEXT COMMENT____ 
An n=5 is really not a large enough sample to draw compelling statistical inferences.  Also, you chose foods containing MSG.  This probably breaks the blind to some degree, as people have some knowledge of foods/food types that contain MSG.  This is not to mention that at least for one of you (i.e., the person that chose the foods) there was no blind whatsoever.  If you use actual MSG, which is available in powder form, and dissolve it in water you could double-blind this study.  You should also take care to have control samples that would just be water with an non-active powder (maybe baking soda or something) dissolved into the water so subjects won't be able to tell the difference. Lastly, you definitely should have more than 5 people.

For those interested in a review of the scientific evidence people can look at [this paper](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2222.2009.03221.x/full) ",

They did a test about this on a TV show once. Put a bunch of people in a room who claimed they got headaches from MSG. They told everyone the food had MSG but it didn't. Most of the people started to complain about getting a headache.",
33,"MSG is made much like yogurt or soy sauce and is just as safe . It has been given a bad rap because of ignorant clean diet fanatics. One reason is the use of it's chemical name . If it was called umami powder there wouldn't be a problem. This is what the FDA says; FDA considers the addition of MSG to foods to be “generally recognized as safe” (GRAS). Although many people identify themselves as sensitive to MSG, in studies with such individuals given MSG or a placebo, scientists have not been able to consistently trigger reactions.",

65,What's wrong with MSG? MSG is the bomb. ,
633,"My top suggestion would be to replace chili powder with chili puree. Toast whole chilies (I like a combo of guajillo, ancho, and cayenne. I've used cascabel too,) lightly on a pan. Remove stems and seeds and steep in 2c boiled water from a kettle. Use an amount of water appropriate for how many chilies, you want to have a thick puree, which you get by blending, preferably an immersion blender.  

I'll brown up some steak cubes, and brown ground pork and remove. I try to get as much grease rinsed out as I can. Lightly brown onions and garlic. If you like green onions as a garnish, I suggest adding the white parts sliced in this step as well. Then I'll add my peppers, I like poblanos, jalapenos, and serranos. Roast them ahead of time if you want, or don't, but cook them in oil for less time if you roasted them. They should still be firm before your liquid goes in. Add the meat back, and add beef stock, diced tomatoes or whole tomatoes. I prefer the latter because you can crush them into the size you want. We like a few large chunks so that's why I do that. I don't have amounts because people may want more or less liquid. I like a good amount of liquid. Add your chili puree, and add something dark. Usually I'll save a cup of coffee from the morning, and I'll try and make sure I have some kind of dark beer to go in as well. I've done the dark chocolate squares too. Just a lot of early complexity comes from those things. Season what you've got with salt, black pepper, a pinch of white pepper if you've got it, cumin (toasted and ground whole seeds are best,) oregano. Nothing wrong with adding garlic and/or onion powder too, or anything else you enjoy.   

As for the beans, I guess it depends on your cooking time. I don't always simmer my chili all day. But with canned beans I dont add them right at this point as I dont want them too soft. I use 1 can each of pinto, black, and light kidney beans. I've had chili with garbanzo beans too, that was pretty good.  

Always check for seasonings at the end. Dont be afraid to use a pinch of MSG if you have it (fight me.) But I think my favorite and most important step is that I add the juice of one lemon to it when it's nearly done. Limes would make more sense for a lot of people, but anything works. Meyer lemons are a dream for this as well. It makes a tasty chili!

tl;dr I fucking love chili and you should go read what I wrote 

 ____NEXT COMMENT____ 
Sounds like increasing your salt would be beneficial, and I would strongly recommend a pinch of msg as well. Tomatoes have some umami on their own, but I have found the flavor can be really great with a bit of that. If you're not familiar with MSG, keep in mind it is NOT a salt replacer, it works with salt in a smaller amount to work it's magic. Also when I make sauce I sauteed onions and celery in olive oil for a bit before adding tomatoes. I blend my sauce as well, but I feel the browning adds some base richness as well. Happy cooking!

339,"It's not the cooking.  It's the marination.   Chinese cooking traditionally marinates beef in a ""coating"" consisting largely of rice wine and corn starch or other starch, plus maybe some combination of soy sauce, ginger, garlic, sesame oil, etc.  Adding baking soda to the basic marinade will make the beef soft but some people don't like it.  Adding MSG also works.",
946,"This is not as pretty as stock, but it's very flavorful. If the meat shop dry ages beef, ask them to save the bones and scraps when they break down the primary. Mine charges the same price as normal bones because no one else knows to ask for them.   

You want to greatly increase surface area to ensure that all the tasty stuff dissolves into the water. Put the bones in a strong cloth bag and smash them with the biggest hammer you have access to. No need to obliterate them, just break them into several pieces.    

 If you roast them in the oven make sure to deglaze the pan. I just roast them in the soup pot with the lid on, stirring every few minutes. When they're nearly done, add the vegetables/spices and roast them. As other's have said star anise is also a must. Then stir in some shrimp paste, let it carmelize a bit. I prefer the filipino Bagoong alamang, it adds lots of flavor but it's not as funky. Deglaze with michiu, sake, shochu or dry sherry. then add the cold water. Simmer on low overnight. Do not bring it to a boil. Sieve. Make caramel with your sugar. I just mix water and sugar in a bowl and put it in the microwave at 15-30 second intervals until it browns. Add fish sauce, you shouldn't need msg or salt. Chill and skim. 

There are 2 items which I highly recommend, as a substitute for shrimp paste, though they aren't traditional, only add one. Dried cuttlefish, pulverized in a food processor/blender. Do this a little at a time unless your appliance is powerful. Add it shortly before the veggies.  Sea urchin roe, add it to the hot stock before you serve, that will be enough to cook it. ",

196,"I never used to have a strong opinion about preservatives until I started getting Migraines.

My migraines can be triggered by a number of factors (fluctuations in barometric pressure, changes in hormones, the smell of nicotine) but artificial/synthetic preservatives in food are guaranteed triggers for me.

Nitrates/Nitrites, commonly found in pork products found on the U.S. will give me a migraine like you can't believe. If I have a single bite of bacon that doesn't say, ""Nigrate Free"" on the packaging, it's less than an hour before I want to bludgeon my head open to stop the pain.

Sorbates, Sulfites, Benzoates, Propionates, High Fructose Corn Syrup, MSG, TBHQ and many others are all added to our packeged foods.

A few years ago I only would've recognized two or maybe three of those preservatives. Now I know what they all are because I know what goes into all of my food purely out of necessity.

Now that my diet greatly dictates my quality of life I view my food differently than I used to (funny how that works) and I firmly believe that those chemicals are not good for our bodies.

If my brain knows immediately that I have ingested a foreign chemical and causes me pain as a result; it tells me that preservatives probably aren't good for anyone even if they don't get migraines.

Of course this is to be taken with a grain of salt. We all ingest foods that we probably shouldn't (I'm looking at you cinnamon rolls) so it's probably fine for most people to have some preservatives in their lives, but being aware of how much they are consuming them and trying to limit that consumption is a good idea.

I know that I personally had absolutely no clue as to how many preservatives I was consuming until I literally had to look at every single label of every single product that I was using and I was shocked to find that they were everywhere.

Homemade veal, chicken, and lobster stock, which I make in 2-3 gallon batches and store with a pressure-canner (if you have a large freezer that would be a little easier).

Subliminal dosing of cayenne pepper and nutmeg in sauces.

I always keep an uncooked Broadbent (have not tried other makers) country ham in the fridge.  It basically does not go bad, a little bit goes a long way in vegetable dishes and Chinese dishes, and can also be sliced thin and served like prosciutto.

Good olive oils - not the kind they sell at the grocery store.  I usually have at least 5 of them.  I buy the smallest bottles because the larger ones go rancid before I finish them.  Frantoia and Sitia 0.3 would be a good start.  My favorite is Abbae de Quiles.  I don't add them until the end of cooking, of course.

Duck fat and suet are always in the freezer.

Canned San Marzano tomatoes - buy them by the case.

Good butter - I like Strauss, sometimes I get Lurpak.

Agree with MSG.  I actually use Haimii (sold at Japanese grocery stores) which is a mixture of MSG and another glutamate.

Get your meat from a real butcher.  Get your sausages from someone who makes them for a living.  Local vegetables.  Fish should be fresh enough to eat raw, even if you cook it.  Your cooking is only as good as your ingredients.

Other great ""secret"" ingredients - XO sauce (get one that's heavy on scallops and light on liquid), Nam Pla, Yuzu Kosho, Sansho, anchovies.

I have a windowsill planter with most herbs that I use.

Make a point of not buying Chinese garlic - it is lacking in flavor compared to what we grow in the USA.

Any other cut of meat won't be right -- unless you live in a city where you can get real [Churrasco](http://media.photobucket.com/image/recent/tastychomps/EL%2520CORRAL/el-corral-5.jpg), which is (from a taste and texture perspective) essentially a cross between flank and skirt and in my not-so-fucking-humble opinion the absolute best piece of meat imaginable. When you're done seasoning/rubbing/marinating (see below), you want to grill it (or pan sear both sides and finish it in a hot oven), quick and hot, just enough to sear the outside and get the inside to medium rare. Let it rest, lay it on your cutting board, and look for the grain. It will look kind of like |||| running one direction through the meat. You want to cut your slices so your blade is at a 45* angle from the board and you're cutting across those grains at a 45* angle (That's two 45* angles -- one the knife's perspective relative to the board like a miter saw, the other the knife's perspective relative to how it's intersecting the grains in the meat). Hold your knife so that from the side it looks like a backslash (""\""). Cut thin. Save all the juices and bits of rub that accumulate, and dump them and all the meat in a bowl and toss -- you'll see that the meat sucks up everything it gave up. Try a slice. It's juicy, tender, flavorful. 

I cannot stress to you the importance of these points -- choose the right meat, cook it right, rest (REST IT!), then slice it appropriately. You'll be amazed at how much a difference you'll notice just in any one of these choices. You don't even need to season the steak past a fat sprinkle of salt on both sides and these four choices will [revolutionize your burritos](http://gifs.gifbin.com/reverse-1232550555_mexican%20trippin.gif). You'll end up resenting the vegetables and tortilla for wasting belly space that could have been taken up by more meat.

When using chicken, just stir-fry it -- slice it like I describe above, season it, heat up a pan, cook it through, then deglaze the pan with some beer and lime (to pick up and coat the chicken pieces with all the yummy brown bits). (I recommend slicing and then cooking the chicken to maximize surface area and even-out the cooking time -- cooking a whole tit in its cylindrical shape minimizes surface area and, since the breast is much thicker in some parts than others, cooks unevenly.) You want slices, not chunks (imagine the difference between layers of easy-to-bite-through slices and big old hunks of chicken meat tumbling out your burrito. 

As for seasoning your meat: you want to rub it with salt and cumin at the very least. Chili or chile powder is a good addition -- preferably that [made entirely of your choice of one dried pepper](http://www.spicesinc.com/p-823-serrano-chile-powder.aspx) (not the ""mixes"" they sell in the seasoning isle) is best. Smoked paprika is another good addition. If you like it extra hot, chop up finely and add one or two [chipotle en adobo](http://www.mexgrocer.com/1349.html?mr:trackingCode=99293CB0-C040-E211-BFCC-001B21A69EB0&amp;mr:referralID=NA&amp;mr:adType=pla&amp;mr:ad=20095067647&amp;mr:keyword=&amp;mr:match=&amp;mr:filter=20607592087&amp;gclid=CLDXpMShxbQCFQeDnQodXwMACQ) and don't forget to include the juice. Lime is your friend -- add lime. I approve of MSG and add the recommended amount to all the meats I cook (unless the recipe already includes high-glutamate items like soy sauce and mushrooms). But, if nothing else, salt and cumin (and lime). The longer it sits the better. 

That above is really all you need for a good steak or chicken burrito -- everything else pales in comparison to the importance of the above. But just in case:

Assuming you're adding onions and peppers, I recommend sweet onions and red or yellow peppers (they're sweeter). Slice them in rings or strips and give them a quick grilling or char in the pan (i.e., a light coat of non-stick spray on a hot pan, little stirring around so they get a little black in spots). Experiment with all those hot peppers supermarkets carry now -- they also like char. If you must use lettuce, get romaine (fuck iceberg) or get bold and try out some thinly sliced red cabbage (fuck yeah, cabbage). Get cilantro up in that bitch. If you're going to do cheese, get real [queso blanco](https://www.karouncheese.com/images/products/92_tn330_KAROUN-queso-blanco-2.jpg) (fuck cheddar and double-fuck ""Mexican blend""). If you're going to use [pico de gallo](https://www.google.com/search?num=10&amp;hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;site=imghp&amp;tbm=isch&amp;source=hp&amp;biw=1272&amp;bih=783&amp;q=pico+de+gallo&amp;oq=pico+de+&amp;gs_l=img.3.0.0l10.1058.2097.0.3345.8.7.0.0.0.0.67.421.7.7.0...0.0...1ac.1.EqJAqX9ApsY), make it from scratch - recipes abound on the internet, and the one ""trick"" is putting the onion and garlic in a wire mesh strainer and pouring boiling salted water over them to take off the raw bite. Minimize your use sour cream or salsa, especially store-bought salsa (they'll just cover up all the delicious flavors you've spent all this time working on). Do heat up the tortillas so they're pliable and so that you can smell/taste them more. 

Enjoy.

157,"Ew what the hell.  I am also astounded when people will blindly follow things they hear or read about involving anything scientific, considering it is always changing.  I would hope they would realize that the recommendations for how you should break down your calories between fats, carbs, and protein are just that recommendations and aren't just blatantly eat this much of that always.  

I also don't see how people just think well low-carb or low-fat is the way to go.  Any diet has it's good and bad parts to it.  A lot of people in the past 20 years have gotten fat off of low-fat diets because through ignorance they don't seem to realize that many low-fat foods are just insanely high in carbs and therefore they don't end up bettering themselves at all.

I actually had a friend of mine just straight up tell me MSG will definitely cause cancer and that nobody should ever eat any amount of it.  I told him that is complete bullshit and there's even any amount of studies that would show while it obviously isn't good to have too much of it, it isn't as bad as he seems to think.  Of course he would have none of it and just stuck to his thinking.  The sad part is he is a well educated very smart person, but somehow is like that about these types of things.",

If they are using soy sauce it contains higher amounts of glutamic acid then some foods that have it added in.  By the legal definition soy sauce doesn't have to say it has MSG in it since it is naturally occurring and it isn't added in.

This is called [Anecdotal evidence](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Anecdotal_evidence).

Also if I were to flip a coin 100 times and guess the correct answer every time it doesn't mean I can tell the future.  The studies of large groups of people found no evidence that people could tell a difference.

On an aside there are tons of foods out there with naturally high levels of Glutamic acid which is what MSG is.  Those foods don't have to be labeled either because it is naturally occurring.",
643,"Just saw this video and it reminded me of campfire onions my friend taught me. 

You remove the root end of the onion and sort of core it so you get a little room in the onion. Jam a boullion cube in there and optionally some butter. 

Wrap in foil and toss it in the camp fire (or hot oven) for a while.

End result is glorious, chicken or beef MSG butter packed soft roasty onion.

 ____NEXT COMMENT____ 
Stews / curries and beans are the winners IMO.

They don't take a lot of time to make a large batch, most of the time spent is waiting, and they reheat very well. 

A pot of curry or stew and a pot of beans in the fridge + some rice = meal ready in 5 minutes any time you want!

For best ROI skip the searing of meat and go for other seasonings to deliver extra flavor, like fish sauce, soy sauce, curry, msg, beef/chicken boullion etc.

MSG.",
637,"There's no proof of it happening to literally anyone. It's certainly plausible that there can be an allergy to it (as there can be bad reactions to anything, even water), but the large number of people who are ""allergic"" likely are not, based on all studies down which cannot show such a link in double blind studies.

If anything, it's probably more a bad reaction to high sodium consumption, as the foods with high MSG are almost always high in sodium. Anything in large quantities is going to make people feel shitty, but that doesn't make it an allergy.

He actually addresses it in the comments of the main article there when a couple people tell him that the chicken is brined in pickle juice instead of plain salt water.

&gt;I’ve heard that from a few sources, but the ingredients list on their website doesn’t seem to corroborate the claim. For example, there’s no vinegar, calcium chloride, or lactic acid listed under their chicken ingredients, all of which would have to be listed there if they were using actual pickled juice. The ingredients only list salt, sugar, MSG, spices, and paprika (and nope, none of those things qualify as FDA-listed “spices,” they’d have to appear separately on the list).


&gt;I’d trust that ingredients list!
