# The Aftertaste of Bad Science: Stances towards MSG of Reddit Users
## TxMM 2021 project: 

This repository contains the software for the Text and Multimedia Mining (TxMM\LET-REMA-LCEX06) course I completed in the first semester of academic year 2020/2021. The full report can be found in the top-level pdf. A short description of the research is:

Monosodium glutamate (MSG) is a cooking salt widely used in
processed foods, seasoning mixes, and Asian restaurants. Despite
its frequent occurrence and the fact that recent research shows that
it is generally safe, recent surveys find that it remains stigmatized
in the eyes of the public. In this research, I annotate data from the
online discussion platform Reddit to investigate Reddit users’ stance
towards MSG. I find that Reddit users generally have positive views
on MSG. Additionally, the results suggest that the MSG perceptions
on Reddit have improved over time. Positive Reddit users often
mention the research that indicates MSG is safe, it’s widespread
usage, and it’s taste. Negative Reddit users often mention anecdotal
evidence.
