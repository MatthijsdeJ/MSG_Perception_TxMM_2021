This [other Harvard study](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10736382), also dated 2000, demonstrates the difficulty in generating a repeatable verification of the purported MSG effect.

[This page](http://allergyadvisor.com/Educational/November03.htm) does a good job of summarizing the extensive research performed on MSG, submitting many references, and demonstrating that most of them have yielded non-repeatable results.  It also clarifies that most studies are too small or too poorly conducted to meet the full rigor of medical science.

In many food-related ""reactions"", the culprit is likely to be the food itself.

So, in response to your ""easier to call people 'dimwits'"" comment, I *have* thought about this topic many times over the years, and there continues to be insufficient proof on the issue.  Most of the positive studies are taken out of context of the full body of medical/scientific evidence, or are tainted by the ""myth"" of MSG.

I did not have to ""demonstrate"" anything, but now I have.

So now it's your turn: can *you* demonstrate that your claim is consistently supported in the literature, preferably with controlled, large group, double-blind, placebo-included studies?  Or are you also just talking off the cuff as you claim I was?

"Have you contacted Thrifty Foods? They probably don't make it but might be willing to give you more info on the product? The wrapper holding the product might have more info as well.

There's no question that it's injection brined - I'm sure the holes close up during cooking. I've seen some TV shows (like How it's Made) and many of the deli meats are injected and vacuum tumbled in a marinade. They are cooked and then vacuum sealed and cooled.

Is the product a solid muscle like a whole top round or such? If not, then it's probably been also tumbled and multiple muscles vacuum sealed to create a solid piece of meat. After it's cooked, the plastic is removed it it goes through a hot oven to give it a dark surface. Probably also treated with coloring.

If I was going to try it, I would make up a marinade of garlic and whatever other spices or herbs you want to try. Include a good portion of MSG as this is commonly used to bump up the flavor. Puree the mixture with some water, let it sit in the fridge for a day or so to extract and then strain so only liquid is left. Then I would take an injector and pump in the liquid into the beef (as I noted, it's probably top round). Do this repeatedly (like 50 times) - then vacuum seal the meat along with the liquid for a day in the fridge.

After a day, remove and dry well. If the product in the deli is very dark, then you need a coloring agent - mix some worchester or soy sauce with some beef stock base (I like Better than Bullion) and rub over the meat.

"""MSG"" only really exists in its pure, crystalline form... but as soon as you cook with it, it breaks down into its respective ions (sodium ion + glutamate).  

The truth is, free glutamate (MSG without the sodium) is found in many foods, *naturally*.  Parmesan cheese, soy sauce, even some veggies and meats.  Sodium is present in most cooked foods as well.  

So, in gauging your reaction to MSG I might also ask for your opinion on how you like soy sauce and parmesan cheese, because eating foods containing these is no different chemically than eating some other foods that have been cooked with MSG.

"The paper discusses the possible genetic predisposition either for the production of MTDH, which ""possibly"" downregulates EAAT2 (the major coder for the glutamate transporter to the brain), or the upregulation of PGCP, which is a precursor for GCPII, which breaks down NAAG into glutamate + NAA for use various bodily functions, including the nervous system.

I was unable to find any papers as to whether or not the glutamate produced from the breakdown of MSG is involved in the production of NAAG, or at least at producing NAAG at high enough levels into the neurological pathways to be considered bad.  Also, it is unclear as to whether or not glutamic acid itself crosses the blood-brain barrier at level that is considered dangerous (I guess it's possible that they didn't consider people with this possible condition).  So, even if you *do* have the disorder, it is up in the air as to whether or not the ingestion of MSG is actually the culprit (sorry that your anecdote doesn't persuade me otherwise).  Human bodies produce glutamate themselves, and it is possible that your own body will produce excess glutamate at times, perhaps in reaction to some other stimulus, causing migraine.

[this article says it's uncertain as to where the glutamate comes from in the intro](http://www.jbc.org/content/272/17/11276.full), however, it is possible that it comes from MSG.

Given that people eating traditional diets with low amounts of processed or ""unnatural"" foods have much, much lower incidences of cancer, diabetes, heart disease, etc than people who eat a ""western diet"" with lots of processed food and modern food additives, its a good bet there's something wrong with the ""western diet"".

"What kind of chinese cooking are you making?  American Chinese?  Cantonese? Hunan?  Northern?  Sichuan? Each region has it's own unique cooking style.

Egg roll filling and General Tso?  This is American Chinese.  You're missing the secret ingredient... MSG.

The basics of Chinese is a hot wok, gas fired is best.  Oil - it HAS to be near smoking point.  Are you using canola or peanut?  Lots of Chinese restaurants use peanut because of the higher smoking point.  Soggy vegetables?  You're cooking it too long and/or the julienne might be not thin enough.

Frying?  Use canola if you have to, peanut is better.

Sauces are typically made at the end, pull your food out of the wok, remove excess oil and build the sauce immediately.  After your sauce is done, add the food back in to coat and serve immediately.  Chinese food is meant to be eaten right after it comes out of the wok, so timing is important.

"For breakfast, my favorite cheap, easy, healthy, tasty meal is ""spicy black beans and eggs on whole grain toast"". You can probably guess how it's made, but here's a recipe anyway: 

* Heat up a bit of olive oil in a pan, and stick your favorite brand of whole grain bread into the toaster. 
* When the pan is hot, crack an egg into it. Scramble with a spatula until about halfway cooked
* Spoon a few dollops of canned black beans and a generous helping of hot sauce right on top. Continue to scramble until done, then scoop the entire mess on top of your toast.

By the way, a notable advantage of whole grain bread is that it has a much longer shelf life than white bread. I go one step further and get ""[double fiber whole wheat](http://www.naturesownbread.com/NAT_Varieties/Variety.cfm?CategoryID=100&amp;ProductID=16)"" which never goes bad. Ever.

Fried rice is ridiculously easy to make, and cheap to boot. The best part is that it takes advantage of leftover food. There are plenty of recipes out there, but here's a (relatively) short version: 

* Heat up canola oil in a pan, toss in whatever vegetables and/or meat you want in the rice. This can be leftovers you have from a previous meal, cheap frozen veggies, or those of the fresh variety. 
* When this stuff is heated, add rice. Leftover rice that has been sitting in the refrigerator actually works better, but fresh rice is okay too. 
* Stir everything until the rice is completely coated with oil, then push it to the side and crack an egg in the pan. Scramble that motherfucker and mix it with the rice.
* Toss in some soy sauce. You can add whatever other spices you think will taste good at this point - I like garlic powder, lemongrass, coriander seed, MSG, or whatever strikes my fancy at the time. Continue to stir everything until the brown from the soy sauce has spread out evenly over the rice, then turn the heat off and prepare to serve.

Stir-fry is even easier. All you really need to know is: Oil, meats and veggies, soy sauce, spices, maybe sesame oil, a stove, and a pan. Combine all those ingredients and stir. Serve with rice.

We all know that mercury is the sweetest of the heavy metals, and canned tuna is the best source of mercury on the consumer market. It's also cheap, nonperishable, easy to prepare, and otherwise healthy. The laziest option by far is tuna salad, which is a fine sandwich filler. This is just tuna, mayo, chopped celery, and whatever spices you think would taste good.

Also: Peanut butter. I think [this stuff](http://www.amazon.com/Smart-Balance-Natural-Peanut-16-Ounce/dp/B001M22TA4/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=grocery&amp;qid=1280168401&amp;sr=8-1) is really goddamn good tasting, and leagues healthier than Jif, Peter Pan, and the like. But whatever your choice, peanut butter goes on everything, from fruit to bread to crackers to a spoon. One of my favorite applications is the peanut butter, banana, and honey sandwich, which I will not insult you by providing a recipe for.

"basically, after listening to my mom and the people who bug her every week for kimchee. i think her kimchee is probably the best i had. i'm not just saying that, others tend to agree.

the best analogy i can think of is that kimchee is like a slaw. and there are many kinds of slaw. there are tons of varieties of kimchee depending on the kind of vegetable used, but there are certain ingredients that you'll never see used. korean cooks tend to be traditionalists and you will never see current ingredients in there like siracha. 

sorry, but i don't have exact measurements for you, but i do have general guidelines that are consistent in the making of kimchee. basically there is a rotting/fermenting agent. usually it is raw oysters, raw fish, fish sauce (most moms will say to use the fish sauce without the MSG), or dried squid. There is a 4 hour stage that you brine the vegetable in a sugar and salt mixture and wash. this stage is important because it breaks down the cellular structure. do it too long and the kimchee will be mush. not enough and it will not ripen correctly. you won't get that tangy, bubbly, crunchy texture. instead, it will smell like old socks also i have a theory that if you don't wash your hands correctly or if you introduce harmful bacteria, the fermentation process will not work properly and the kimchee will be funky.

anyway, after the brine mix in coarse dried red pepper, (fine red pepper is only used for color but add some anyway), kosher salt or sea salt, sugar, garlic, ginger and a rotting agent. If you are using napa you need to rub it in to each individual leaf. that is basically it. you add onions for sweetness, too much and the kimchee turns out slimy. you add ""buchu"" i think americans call it garlic chive. i think chinese call it gao choy. garlic chive will add the garlic and onion flavor. you can add green onion / scallion and or daikon radish. its the same ingredients that you see koreans use in all of their dishes. 

also about fermenting, since it is cold out. you can leave it out for a few days to ripen. leave the jar cracked open and make sure there is space left in the jar because the liquid will rise. in 70 degree weather, i think one day out. and put it back into the fridge. a slow fermentation will make for a crunchier texture. add too much salt and the fermentation process will take longer, but also the kimchee will last longer before it goes into no mans land.

don't trust any recipe that says to add red bean paste or siracha. and 
sorry for the format. i was just writing it as i was thinking it. oh yeah, if you are making cucumber kimchee, make sure to blanch it for a few seconds to take off the wax.

i hope this serves as a guide.

"1). Get some bacon, beef liver, and onions.  Fry the bacon in the (pre-seasoned) pan.  Pull the bacon out and dry it on some paper towels, but leave the grease in the pan.  Dredge the liver in some flour (maybe spiked with some garlic powder and MSG).  Slice and saute the onions with a pinch of salt in the grease.  Dredge the liver again in the flour and cook it until GBD (golden brown &amp; delicious).  If you didn't think you liked liver, you will now.

2.) Save some bacon and some of the grease if it isn't too contaminated with flour.  Put 3 eggs in a bowl and whisk with 3 T water or 2 T half and half or 2T heavy cream, in increasing order of desirability.  Throw a healthy slab of cooled bacon grease or butter in the pan until it barely smokes.  Drop in the eggs and manipulate until you have a reasonably smooth ""patty"" (GBD on the bottom) with some runny stuff on top.  This takes a little practice to get right, but the experiments are still good eating.  Flip it over mid-air (this takes even more practice) or use a plate to make it a two-step process.  But a nice handful of sharp cheddar and some chopped bacon on one half.  When the cheese has almost melted, fold over.  Perfect omelet.  Or leave out the bacon and slather the top with salsa and some hot sauce: spanish omelet.

3.) Find a way to get your pan as hot as possible - outdoors.  I like a butane stove ($20 at a Chinese grocery with extra butane) but a grill works as well; put it ON the hot coals or burner.  You want it HOT.  Take a nice steak and rub some canola or peanut oil on it with your hands, then salt on both sides.  Let rest for 10 minutes.  Throw the steak in the pan and LEAVE IT ALONE for 2 minutes. Don't move it until it releases easily from the pan. Flip and repeat.  If your pan was hot enough you now have a great medium-rare steak.

From a cooking perspective, my advice is that you use it to help out the umami in your foods. It definitely enhances the flavor of anything meaty or proteiny as the other redditors have mentioned. But, if you learn how to cook well, you won't need it. Imagine training wheels. It helps you, but you don't necessarily need them. I think it works to make something taste better than it is.

"Grew up in exactly your situation. Experiment, and try recipes which use odd ingredients (to you), and follow them even if you think it will suffer.  

Stir fry is garlic+ginger, sugar and soy sauce or MSG for clear.  Garlic, ginger, and any onions if used go in first (aromatics), then meat.  Veggies next.  Meats may need to be removed and held aside if they cook too fast. Cook until veggies are tender-crisp while constantly stirring.

That's actually good advice for any cuisine: Hot oil, garlic and onions, then brown meat.  Never underestimate the power of browning.  Caramel is sugar, cream and butter browned, it obviously is better than it's parts. 

Hummus is healthy and can be spiced up to your taste level.  Garbanzos, tahini, olive oil, lemon juice, garlic, cumin, optionally coriander and hot sauce. Blend, let set for an hour or more in fridge.

"Thai-style sauce is really easy to make, and is great on lots of things. I was able to wing one after eating some Thai beef and cobbling together a little info on Thai cooking. 

Get a can of coconut milk, toss it in a saucepan. Add a generous squirt of ketchup, a few heaping tablespoons of peanut butter, and Sri Racha hot sauce to taste. Whisk together while heating, simmer for a bit. This makes a good base to which you can add all kinds of things--meat, veg, pour it over rice or noodle dishes, you name it. 

Also, the 5-minute miracle, yakiniku! My fiance got me on this one when he introduced me to Japanese cooking (he worked the kitchen in a Japanese restaurant for 3 years). Take a good cut of steak, and slice it into thin strips about 3 inches wide. Pour a few tablespoons of sesame oil into a stir-fry or saute pan and heat on medium-high. Make a teriyaki sauce: 1 part soy sauce, 1 part mirin (Japanese sweet rice seasoning sauce) or honey, whisked together. Add some minced garlic and fresh grated ginger to the teriyaki sauce (you'll want about 1 Tbsp per 6 oz. of meat, I think, maybe more). When the pan is hot, toss your steak pieces in, flip them a few times (by which I mean up in the air), then add the sauce and stir for about 1 minute. It really shouldn't take more than 2-3 minutes to cook the meat--you want it a little rare. Then pour the whole concoction into a bowl. You can serve it over rice or noodles, or just eat it up. 

We also like making ""sushi salad,"" which you will sometimes see as a brunch dish, apparently. For this you'll want a portion of sashimi-grade fish (we use salmon and tuna); it won't take much, about 3-4 oz. of each to serve two. You'll also want to get some sushi vegetables--carrots, cucumber and daikon radish are great--Japanese mayonnaise (it's got MSG in it; Kewpie brand is pretty good) and a little bit of hot sauce or wasabi. Cut the vegetables into long, thin strips and put them into your bowls. Slice the fish in thin strips and stick it on top (you can also sear it very lightly in a hot pan with sesame oil before slicing). Mix together a little mayo and hot sauce/wasabi to make spicy mayo. Dress the salads with spicy mayo and/or teriyaki sauce. Quick, simple, delicious.",MSG,multirachael,2,Cooking,2010-06-16 17:24:57 UTC,6,2010

"My wife is Japanese - she says I am a better cook of Japanese food than her mom is. Why? Because I understand the philosophy behind what I am doing. 

Thus, I think you should begin by learning classic techniques and the ideas behind them. I believe the reason I am a better cook of Japanese food than her mom is that I know how to make Chinese dishes, she does not.

I was fortunate to have a lot of talented people teach me a lot of things. Following a recipe isn't enough. You need to learn ""why"" as well. For an example - why do you use a round-bottom wok? Because you use less oil. Dishes don't come out the same with more oil. 

Another example: people here have talked about fried rice. I haven't read any of their links - generally I don't bother because I know it's a straight Western step-by-step recipe. They don't tell you the key, which is day-old rice. Fresh rice is too moist and sticky. Will it tell you why you must use a long grain rice? Westerners just think ""oh, I'll substitute x for y"" - no, it doesn't work like that. If you use the wrong kind of rice, it won't stir fry. You need to use sesame oil in the wok and a tiny bit of fat/lard. It takes high heat and presents a certain flavour authentic to fried rice. Do you add soy sauce? Why or why not? Generally you add some salt AND MSG for a restaurant-like taste. 

Do they tell you that you remove and set aside things and add them again? That you blanch or cook the vegetables first, then remove them? That you then scramble the egg in the wok with a little oil and remove it? Then you quickly cook the rice, careful to never let it linger over the direct heat and add your veggies and egg afterward?

See, you won't know this unless you actually have it explained to you because you'll skip steps. Look for the why - the how will happen. I can usually replicate a dish I've never had because I know the why.",MSG,smacksaw,21,Cooking,2010-12-31 04:03:09 UTC,12,2010

Currently I will get a mild headache, and get drowsy and will mostly recover in about 2-3 hours.

Yes I'm sure there are people who claim to be adverse to this that and the other and are attention whores, but trust me, it would be far easier to not have to check ingredients for a quarter of the stuff I put in my mouth, or to not have to deal with the consequences when I don't or when I say 'ah fuck it', but I do.

I absolutely hate that any Chinese type place I go into I have to ask about it, not be able to trust their answer as they often premake things like eggrolls or use bought in sauces that they don't know the ingredients of, or marinate their meats in an MSG sauce, so even if you specifically request no MSG, you'll often get at least some.

"Not MSG, just glutamic acid which results in the *umami* ""taste"" (really more a *feel* as we describe it in English).

Of course demi-glace has it; you find glutamate in almost anything protein-rich (like a strong veal stock + espagnole) although kombu is best for Japanese cooking (and not as good as fish sauce in most Western cooking) due to the flavour.",MSG,ReallyEvilCanine,1,Cooking,2010-11-05 07:08:40 UTC,11,2010
"The problem is that in studies (see Wikipedia) it's been shown that the symptoms are psychosomatic. Sounds like the blind taste tests you participated in were just that-- taste tests. MSG affects the flavor of dishes and can be easily identified by those that are used to looking for it. The useful study model involves consuming it via a pill or something else that bypasses the taste buds, then eating food.

I'm pretty much over my asthma as I outgrew it, but the last two times as an adult that I've had to get an adrenalin shot in hospital was because of MSG.

I think it's risky to put in food you serve others. I don't cook with peanut oil for friends, for an example.

One thing I disagree with is that MSG offers a more intense flavour. If you're using crappy, iodized salt, sure. But if you're actually putting quality, care and love into your cooking, you're using kosher salt at worst and fleur de sel at best. If you want your reputation to get better, why use an additive that is known for making $0.37 burritos at Walmart be able to be that cheap when you could use the best?

If you want to talk about complex flavours, try sea salt from Scotland, Hawaii or France.

If you're in need of umami, try adding a little Thai fish sauce. It doesn't make things taste fishy and it adds the savoury/fullness you're looking for. It works especially well in vinaigrettes and tomato sauces as well as with beef and, of course, seafood.

You can also get loads of umami by soaking some kombu seaweed. Rinse the kombu to remove the salt, then basically make a tea out of a palm-sized piece.

"I have known for a long time that I've had a sensitivity to MSG.  It's not so much the MS but the G, glutamate.  It's not only found in MSG but also autolyzed yeast extract, and hydrolyzed proteins (to state the most common).  It also occurs naturally in many basic foods, ie tomatoes or cheese.  

Glutamic acid is found in two isomers, L- and D-.  The D- configuration is the naturally occurring isomer and I have not determined my own sensitivity to it.  The -L isomer results from human processing, and this is the one I need to watch out for.  L- is the chirality of glutamic acid found as a food additive and I, for some reason, am very sensitive to it.  If I ingest a small quantity I have no reaction.  There seems to be some threshold I need to cross before I get one of my blinding migraines.  I've also noticed that increased heart rate through exercise increases my chance to react to glutamate ingestion.  This I attribute to an increased accumulation in brain's blood vessels.  

A recent paper published in Nature Genetics indicates there is a genetic marker for glutamate sensitivity, and the researchers have tied it to migraine-like reactions.  Here's the link to Reuters story: http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE67S1PN20100830  The paper itself requires a subscription but can be easily found from that link.

I used research techniques, and myself as a guinea pig, to determine the cause of my migraines.  This is how I determined MSG or glutamate as the culprit.  

Now I try to avoid glutamic acid as best I can and have reduced my migraine incidents to about one per year.  Nobody can completely avoid glutamate.  Most people aren't sensitive and it's not a bad salt to cook with, just not for me.

All you're doing is making yourself feel self-righteously good at (potentially) someone else's expense.

Filling:
1 cup sour cream
7 ounce can of diced green chiles
2 bunches of scallions, chopped
1/2 cup of fresh chopped cilantro
1 1/2 teaspoons of ground cumin
2 cups of diced cooked chicken (i left this out of half the recipe for my vegetarian daughter and did not notice much difference)
1 cup of grated Mexican cheese
1 can black beans
1 can corn (or 1.5 cans frozen/fresh corn)

Season with salt and pepper

Spread tortillas with refried beans and add filling - roll.

Cover with enchilada sauce (i used 1 small can red; 1 small can green, and i poured some in the pan before putting the enchiladas in.)

Cover with foil and bake it at 350 for about 45 minutes. Top with 1 more cup of melted cheese and bake until melted.

"Straight from Wikipedia:

Subsequent research found that, while large doses of MSG given without food may elicit more symptoms than a placebo in individuals who believe that they react adversely to MSG, the frequency of the responses was low and the responses reported were inconsistent, not reproducible, and not observed when MSG was given with food. No statistical association has been demonstrated under controlled conditions, even in studies with people convinced that they are sensitive to it.

Adequately controlling for experimental bias includes a double-blind placebo-controlled (DBPC) experimental design and the application in capsules because of the strong and unique after-taste of glutamates.[19] In a study performed by Tarasoff and Kelly (1993) subjects were given 5 g of MSG to 71 fasting participants, and then administered a standard breakfast. There was only one reaction, and it was to the placebo in a self-identified MSG sensitive individual. [16] In a different study done by Geha et al. (2000), they tested the reaction of 130 subjects that reported sensitivity to MSG. Multiple DBPC were performed and only subjects with at least two symptoms proceeded. Only 2 people out of the whole study responded in all four challenges. Because of this low prevalence, the researchers concluded that the response to MSG was not reproducible [22] Additional studies have looked into whether MSG causes obesity have given mixed results.[23][24] There have been concerns that MSG may be associated with migraine headaches,[25] food allergies in children,[26] obesity,[27] and hyperactivity in children.[28] There have also been many studies trying to find an association with MSG and Asthma. Woessner et al. (1999) conducted a study with 100 subjects (30 who claimed to have experienced MSG induced asthma and 70 who were acetylsalisilic acid asthmatics) that were given 2.5 g and only one participant had a 20% decline in forced expiratory volume, but this finding was not reproduced.

"No worries. Also forgot to note: don't eat the star of anise. I'm sure you would know not to do that...but we've had guests who've tried so just a word of precaution. 

Also, while I'm at it - I just asked my mum for the steamed bun recipe but she's not really able to give me accurate amounts (I think I know where my habit of lax measurements comes from). 

But no worries, here's a dumpling recipe I did manage to eke out of mum a while ago:

**Skin:** 

You can make these...but really, it's not worth the effort. We just buy them from the Chinese Grocers. 

**Filling:**

150g Pork Mince

Half a Cabbage finely chopped (whenever we make these it is my role to hand chop them. Or you can use a food processor though according to my mum it does the job too fine. :( I'd still go with the food processor though). 

Pinch of Salt.

1-2 Spring Onion/Shallot chopped fine.

1/2 Carrot chopped fine. 

2 tspn Soy Sauce

1 tspn Sesame Oil

pinch of Chicken Powder (MSG) and salt 

*Method*

Mix Cabbage and salt thoroughly. Squeeze all the excess water out. Drain (you will want to do this thoroughly. A watery filling is difficult to wrap. Mix rest of the ingrediants together. Again adjust for a 香 fragrant taste. 

Now, place a tspn of filling in dumpling skin and wrap. Use water to seal the edges if necesarry. I'm not really able to show you how to wrap to get the nice wrinkled effect but as long as you get the entire thing sealed you'll be fine. 

Fry on high heat one side until golden. Then flip over. Add a little water and cover for 5 min on low heat. Hopefully you did not add too much water (else you end up with soggy dumplings). Remove the lid and cook until all the water has evaporated. 

Note: You can freeze the dumplings for later. No need to defrost. Just steam for longer! :D

Also, it's not a website but one book I highly recommend as an introduction into Chinese Cooking is *The Chinese Kitchen* by Deh-ta Hsiung. It basically covers most of the ingredients used in Chinese/Taiwanese cooking as well as most of the popular recipes. 

One of the things it explains is the sauces we use ie. Soy sauce. In chinese, the more accurate translation would be Soy Oil 酱油. Which explained to me at least, why growing up I'd get confused when my mum would tell me to pass her the 酱油 and I'd go looking for the sesame oil. My poor mum. For the longest time she thought she'd raised a slow child and had given up on me ever being able to survive on my own xD.

"Hi Everr,

I was lucky enough to take extensive lessons when i was in Koh Samui in Thai cookery -I cook Thai curry at least once a week, I think i can help you!

First,I don't know where you are based but if in London,Taj Stores in Brick Lane is the bizz for ALL Asian/indian specialities, for specific Thai stores, you need to go to Chinatown and check out New Loon Moon or See Wo.

If you aren't in London may I suggest www.thai-food-online.co.uk?
You should have no problem finding Kaffir Lime leaves -be aware they are often frozen, doesn't make any difference and much easier to use they keep forever in the freezer, lemongrass sticks freeze really well too.

You should also have no trouble finding Thai basil, often known as holy basil(no idea why!) obviously doesn't freeze as well - you can also grow it yourself very easily- check out Jekka's herb farm in the UK - very good mail order service.

I can't actually recommend a good Thai commercial curry paste -I really can't! they all taste of preservatives and chemicals and they are shit- but...All the Thai supermarkets suggested will have their own Thai home made curry pastes in the fridge, just ask, they are fabulous but only last a week refrigerated!

Fish sauce, I tend to use whatever is most readily available, but always ask the assistant what they recommend, generally the more expensive the better, it'll still be cheap as chips!

As to the two sauces, if one was fish sauce, they other will be Tamarind paste, the way to finish a Thai curry-available everywhere that I have suggested.

The two white substances? one definitely sugar, usually palm sugar and the other .. I'm pretty certain MSG powder! You do NOT need to add this but if you want to you can find it at above recommendations!

Really DON'T be scared of making your own curry paste, as I said I make it at least once a week, it takes me 25 mins to cook a curry, if I use a food processor, slightly longer if I use a pestle and mortar.

I have to run right now but if you are interested, I have great fail safe recipes for green Thai curry paste  but also red and the best !!!!! yellow, which will make you swoon!

I'm just in the process of putting my food blog together, I cook Sri Lankan( spent a long time in Sri Lankan Kitchens learning!) ,Thai and Indonesian(Beef Rendang!) and some Indian curries every week -They are really easy-with the right ingredients!

"i am often the designated cook on camping/hiking trips. 

would be nice to know how many people you're cooking for but in any event here's some great advice:

don't forget the dry beans. and rice of course.  throw some well smoked ham (which will keep unrefrigerated for quite a few days) and it's a very hearty satisfying rejuvenating meal.  just soak the beans starting in the morning and then add the ham in chunks to the pot when you finish the cooking on the beans that evening.  look for a smoked pork hock, the skin of the pork hock can be toasted over the fire. mmmm cracklins.

you might be burning up to six thousand calories per day and that will make for some hungry times so plan for large portions.  there's nothing like fat to really make you satiated and bring your body back into equilibrium with the modern city diet to which we've all become accustomed. don't cheap out on the oil and butter.  strong flavours like chili, pepper, garlic, onions will be appreciated.  also salt, if you sweat anywhere near as much as I do, you'll want to plan to replenish salt on par with water. this is as easy as some cheap potato chips and/or salted nuts.  also, seasoning whatever you cook well with salt will help with making it taste really good for your fellow hikers. 

avoid msg and too much caffeine (ie caffeine pills + hiking = bad) as these can cause sore muscles sooner, which ache for unreasonably extended periods. note that msg is in many prepared products and the law says that it only be listed simply as 'salt' or 'yeast extract' on ingredients list, at least in most areas. 

if you must bring meats, make sure they're preserved well ie canned, smoked, stuffed with preservatives. i really urge you to bring the smoked pork but freeze it before you leave and keep it insulated, just to be on the safe side. i took smoked ribs on a four day hike, and they kept frozen solid wrapped in the middle of my pack for a full 48 hours. i actually had to thaw them before i ate them.

don't forget a nice bottle of booze if you're into that sort of thing. don't break it out until night three or so, should be a nice little surprise if no one else thought of it first. 

learn to catch fish, if you're hiking for six days you'll probably be near somewhere that is rarely fished and if you do, you might have a good little bonus around the campfire one night.  really fun to catch a fish, and adds to the outdoor experience in a way you can't fathom until you've done it. bring a lemon. also tinfoil is your friend. this goes for potatoes and onions too, those little buddies on a campfire can be reaaaaaly good and salty and oily and num num nums. wrap them all up in a tightly sealed purse and plop them on some rocks beside the fire, as close to 400 degrees as you can estimate.

high calorie items in addition to the above and other posters:  avocado.  oil.  ramen are salty and high calorie.  coconut (milk or whole - a curry with cauliflour and potato might be tasty and satisfying) , deep fried tofu (keeps better than the other types as it is par cooked)

"you are right, i was generalizing. however, MSG is likely the cheapest of the lot and the easiest to get - and likely the lowest in sodium, especially if we weigh it against things like parmesan cheese.

""The umami taste is due to the detection of the carboxylate anion of glutamic acid, a naturally occurring amino acid common in meats, cheese, broth, stock, and other protein-heavy foods. Salts of the glutamic acid, known as glutamates, easily hydrolyze and give the same taste. For this reason they are used as flavor enhancers. The most commonly used of these is monosodium glutamate (MSG). While the umami taste is due to glutamates, 5'-ribonucleotides such as guanosine monophosphate (GMP) and inosine monophosphate (IMP) greatly enhance its perceived intensity. Since these ribonucleotides are also acids, their salts are sometimes added together with glutamates to obtain a synergistic flavor enhancement effect.""

Whisky-carmelized onions. Adds a nice smoky flavor. JD works well. That + blue cheese = delicious.

Someone beat me to a ""pita burger"". Definitely use lamb, to answer your question.

If you want a veggie item, grilled(portabello + yellow/green squash + avocado) + cheese + greens wilted on top.

A ""frenchie burger"" is a bbq burger with white cheddar, grilled french/chibatta bread toast on the side, covered in more bbq sauce. ""frenchie"" because it's open-faced, you eat it with a knife+fork, and it has the meat+sauce+starch of a traditional french dish. Variation: burger / toast / fries with peppercorn sauce and melted brie.

A mustard burger. Mustard seed in the patty, glazed with mustard sauce, and served with stone-ground mustard (especially Sierra Nevada's IPA mustard) on top.

Mexiburger: chorizo + beef patty, pepperjack cheese, tomato. Served with either rice + corn, chips, or fried cheese instead of french fries. Make sure to have a spicy salsa on the side.

Umami Burger: burger, portabello, MSG, sharp cheddar, and Worcestershire sauce. Serve without bun.

just in case blown-out taste buds aren't in question, here's the recipe for my grandmother's sauce, improved upon by myself after 7 years of making it:

1 lg. can (32 oz?) of whole or diced tomatoes. i like ""6 in 1"" brand if you can find it.
1 med/16oz can diced tomatoes
1-2 sm/8oz cans tomato paste (depending on how thick/thin you want your sauce)
8-16oz of water, again, depending on your consistency preferences and how long you plan to cook the sauce

1 head of garlic, minced
1/2-1 lg. white onion, diced
a large handful of dried basil
salt, pepper, paprika and cayenne to taste
a pinch or two of sugar, to cut the acidity of the tomatoes

brown onion and garlic in some olive oil at the bottom of a large pot
add all tomato products and water (you want a fair amount of surplus liquid because it cooks down)
stir in all your spices
let simmer for 2-4 hours at med-low heat

for extra-good flavor buy a pack of spicy italian sausages. brown them when you brown the onion/garlic and let simmer with the sauce. makes it extra oily/tasty.

should make enough to serve with a box of good pasta (tinkyada pasta joy, anyone?) and have a jar to spare for use in the next week.

you can also add it to dishes that need a little more of a 'meaty' full flavor  ( think boneless skinless ).... 

DO use it sparingly, a little bit goes a long way, and some people do have a somewhat negative reaction ( mostly headaches ) to the pure form of it when it is used as an additive...

Try some different cheeses.  Gouda is especially nice to mix in to mac and cheese and you can buy goat gouda for those in your life who are intolerant of cows' milk.

Speaking of spicing up meals, what spices do you use?  Here's what I use:

Rooster Sauce - Sriracha is a delicious (and inexpensive) hot sauce that you can add to anything.  It works well in chili, omelets and really anything that you want a little extra heat in.

Cinnamon - This is an underrated spice.  It's for more than just cookies.  It goes great with Salmon and mixes well with other meat dishes, like Spaghetti.  Try it out on dishes when you think it *won't* work; you'll be surprised.  (I will make bets with the professional cook I live with whether it will work in dishes when she asks me to taste and recommend spicing- I can't cook worth a darn but I can season with the best of them.  I seldom lose these bets over cinnamon.  She thinks that it is just not meant for certain dishes.  Do not allow those rules to rule your seasoning.)

Chili powder - I use this to surprise her with flavor, just like cinnamon.  Try it out in dishes like your mac and cheese.

Old Bay - It is for more than just seafood.  We use it almost as much as butter.  It goes great on some pastas, any greenery (if it's green and you're buttering it- try it with Old Bay).  Don't leave it off of your baked potatoes, either.

Fish Sauce - Be very careful with this.  Only 1-3 drops (3 is really pushing it) are needed to add ""umami"" (savory) to any liquid dish.  It goes great with ramen.  (Think the tasty MSG flavor without the headaches and/or cancer.)

Speaking of Ramen, it's one of my best dishes, according to my much-foodier-than-I girlfriend.  Don't stop with the flavor packet (you can leave it out completely, if you're feeling froggy).

I would recommend finding a stock powder with no artificial ingredients or MSG.  There are many varieties around, but if your local supermarket only has the cheap chemical stuff, then a health food shop or wholefood store would be your best bet.

Stock powder can also be used for a range of things:  you can use it as a meat rub when roasting or grilling, you can sprinkle it into the water while you cook vegetables, you can also add it to vegetetables once they're cooked.  Basically it's like a flavoursome alternative to salt.

"Try searching the subreddit for ""student"". You'll get a lot of tips from posts by people exactly like you.

However, learn to cook rice and beans.

Cook some rice according to the package. When it's about 10 minutes until the rice is done, start *cooking* the rest of this. Start preparing it before the 10 minute mark :)


Chop up an onion and some garlic. Saute them in a bit of oil. Let the onions get ""translucent"". In cooking, ""translucent onions"" means ""let them heat up for a few minutes"". They won't actually be translucent, but whatever.


Get some black beans from a can, and rinse them for a while. That gets a fair bit of the sodium out, as far as I know. 

Now that the onions are cooked a bit, throw the beans in. Throw some salt over the whole thing to enhance the flavor.

At this point, you have a hearty, cheap, filling, and...tasteless dish. You need to add some spices. 

Try throwing Cumin and Chili Powder in with it. Or MSG, such as Goya's Sazon.

Apart from salads, it is popular with dishes such as okonomiyaki, takoyaki and yakisoba and may also accompany katsu and karaage. It is sometimes served with cooked vegetables, or mixed with soy sauce or wasabi and used as dips. It is also common in Japan to use mayonnaise on pizza.

No statistical association has been demonstrated under controlled conditions, even in studies with people convinced that they are sensitive to it.**""

"Learning to cook Rice, Broccoli, Beans, and Eggs (not necessarily together) will get you far.  Get your parents to buy you a cheap $20 rice cooker from an asian store and you'll be set for rice.  Broccoli can be steamed in the microwave, or eaten raw, and has a lot of vitamin to keep you going.  Beans (dried or canned) keeps for a long time and is a good source of protein.  You can put it into a crockpot to slowcook while you're at class.  Eggs are also great because they keep for a long long time, they're great for protein, and they can go in almost anything.

Instant ramen is not really that great.  It's a lot of empty calories, the MSG isn't good for you, and you don't really feel full for long.  I would only use that for emergency food when you don't have time to cook or you don't have anything else.

"The Chinese method of cooking veggies isn't usually as boring (and bland) as steamed broccoli - sort of a stir fry but with no meat or soy sauce or anything special other than salt, oil, and garlic. The veggies themselves have wonderful flavor that the garlic brings out.

1. Heat pan (or wok) to medium with some oil (two tbsps?)

2. Chop up garlic to your liking (I love garlic so I use like 3-4 cloves)

3. When pan is hot, throw in garlic

4. When garlic is lightly browned, throw in washed vegetables

5. Salt moderately, stir and cover

6. Stir, occasionally adding a bit of water so it doesn't just burn. Cover.

7. Repeat #6 until nice and steamy.

8. Taste/check your vegetables - are they still raw? They're not supposed to be soft 
nor bland (like boiling or blanching them). Add a pinch of sugar and stir.

9. Eat - enjoy it with the garlic.

This is the standard Chinese way of cooking a vegetable-only dish. It's not bland and boring like boiling them and it doesn't taste gross and raw. There's no MSG or other flavoring other than a bit of salt and garlic. This works for most vegetables.

"My friend's Dad is Vietnamese and had a restaurant, he showed me how he made his, but I have tinkered with the recipe alot, mostly because I always had different ingredients on hand.

Day or two old rice, and if you want to make it healthier, I think it's good with brown rice. I use parboiled rice when I want to make it but don't have any rice made already. Just cook it a tad al dente(does this term apply to rice?), parboiled rice stay separate and firm after cooking.

I scramble my **egg** first, with **kosher salt** and **black pepper**, put it aside.

For meat, I usually use what I have on hand. I have used chicken breast, pork sirloin, ribeye. I cook everything for the fried rice in my cast iron pan. Salt and black pepper, then sear the **meat** on both sides, put aside. (As long as I have my sear, I don't worry much about doneness, the meat will cook more when it goes back in the rice.)

Mince **garlic** and **onions**. Chop **Chinese  sausage** small. Chop **carrots** thinly. **Chop green onions**. Chop meat to bite size, now that it has rested.

Heat pan to medium high heat. Add **oil**. Fried rice needs alot of oil to be really good, remember you are frying it. I usually use **canola or vegetable.** There may be a more appropriate oil, but I keep these on hand, and fried rice is usually a spur of the moment thing for me. 


 
Add chinese sausage (provides extra grease to cook veggies).
Add carrots.
Add garlic and onion. 
In that order.
Add a little **butter**.
Once butter is melting add **rice**.  If you are adding a lot of rice you may need to turn your heat up, you want to maintain temperature.

Add **oyster sauce**.
Add **sweet soy sauce**.
Add a dash of **dark mushroom soy sauc**e.(Mostly for color, I like my fried rice dark.)

Stir vigorously enough to make sure your rice doesn't stick. You want your pan hot, but you don't want sticking rice, there is a fine line. While sauteing rice, add salt, black pepper, **white pepper,** **chinese red pepper**, **msg**(probably about 1/5 or even less the amount of salt you use), add your meat back, egg next, then green onions to finish.

Alot of people finish with sesame oil, I don't. Preference. Also, saw someone else mention lime juice, I might try that, I haven't thought about altering the acidity of my fried rice yet. I might try to deglaze the meat with a little rice vinegar, and pour it out of the pan with the meat while it rests.

MSG is in many [forms](http://www.truthinlabeling.org/hiddensources.html) and naturally occurs in food but I think it's the processed kind that causes issues in most people. I react to it with headaches and an upset stomach.  I discovered this not by ingesting MSG specifically but a variant that is in Flat Earth veggie chips.  I'd eat them and always feel like crap afterward.  I was baffled because MSG was no where in the label.  So I googled the ingredients to see if it may have been something else and found that one of the listed ingredients was actually a type of MSG.  Bastards.  Also all those Asian snack mixes are the worst if you react to MSG.  I'd say delicious Asian snack mixes but I can't even call them that anymore because they make me so damn ill.

"MSG is a sodium ion bound to a glutamate, which is an amino acid. The sodium ion is perceived as a salty taste and the glutamate is perceived as that savory ""umami"" taste, hence why MSG adds as much flavor as i does. Neither of these substances are foreign to the body, and are found in varying amounts in many foods (though not in the same proportion and dose as MSG).

In high doses, MSG carries that same risk that a high dose of salt does: that is, it means you take in a lot of sodium which can make you retain fluid, increase blood pressure, and feel really thirsty or dehydrated.

As far as ""Chinese Food Sickness"": People tend not to realize just how much sodium can be in Chinese food - not just from MSG, but from soy sauce, other seasonings, and preservatives added to the food to prevent spoilage. Combine that with typically massive portions often high in fat and carbohydrate as well, a person post-Chinese meal can be feeling pretty sluggish, thirsty, and thus crappy. 

Some people are quite convinced, however, that MSG makes them sick, and they will in fact ""feel"" sick if they have MSG (or are convinced that they had MSG). This has less to do with the MSG itself and more to do with ""mind over matter.""

TL;DR - MSG is not inherently harmful. It can cause some issues in high doses much like salt can. It gets blamed for people feeling crappy after eating Chinese, but the real culprit there is more likely portion size and Calorie density.",MSG,Mr_McPeanut,11,nutrition,2012-10-01 17:48:31 UTC,10,2012

The Baby Ruth recipe contains 1 cup of peanuts and 8 cups of oatmeal?  WTF?  There's no oatmeal in a Baby Ruth, much less eight times as much as there are peanuts.

Wheat Thins get part of their flavor from malt syrup, which isn't in the recipe given.

Chips Ahoy don't contain eggs.  The recipe given does, which would give the cookies a much different texture and flavor.

Kraft Macaroni and Cheese uses a cheese powder that doesn't contain the fat of regular cheese.  The fat is replaced in the recipe with butter, which creates a not-entirely-real-cheese flavor.  The given recipe contains no butter because normal cheese (if you're willng to call Cheez Whiz normal), which would give a different flavor and texture.

The Starbucks Frappuccino recipe somehow doesn't include ice.  Ice is a major ingredient in the drink.

The Chik-Fil-A sandwich recipe is missing MSG and paprika.  The coating mix uses plain flour while Chick-Fil-A adds barley flour.  The recipe also suggests using your pressure cooker as a pressure fryer, which isn't a good idea since the seals aren't generally designed to withstand the higher temperatures that oil reaches.  If you're going to try pressure frying, you need to use a pressure fryer that's designed for the job.

Wendy's chili uses green bell peppers, not green chilis.  I can't imagine anyone mistaking one for the other.

The Reese's cup recipe says to use regular peanut butter in the center, but the peanut butter in a Reese's cups adds sugar and doesn't add extra oil (that's why it's crumbly and not spreadable like regular peanut butter).  The texture and flavor of regular peanut butter won't come close to being the same.

KFC doesn't taste remotely like Italian dressing mix mixed with tomato soup mix.  It's also deep fried in a pressure cooker, which has a huge impact on the taste and texture.  Frying it in 1/2 inch of oil in a skillet wouldn't turn out remotely close to the same.

Nutri-grain bars.  A Nutri-grain bar contains 3 grams of fat and is made with a mix of plain flour, whole wheat flour and wheat bran.

"Indeed. I'm guessing you're going for generic, ""Tex-Mex""/""Mexican"" food. With ""burrito"" type edibles in particular, it comes down to two tricks -- however you choose and cook your meat, you want to be able to slice it so that it's as tender and ""bite-sized"" as possible and you want to season it very well (you want it to stand up to all the lettuce, tomatoes, cheese, etc that you add later). 

For steak, this means you want skirt or flank. This is critical. Any other cut of meat won't be right -- unless you live in a city where you can get real [Churrasco](http://media.photobucket.com/image/recent/tastychomps/EL%2520CORRAL/el-corral-5.jpg), which is (from a taste and texture perspective) essentially a cross between flank and skirt and in my not-so-fucking-humble opinion the absolute best piece of meat imaginable. When you're done seasoning/rubbing/marinating (see below), you want to grill it (or pan sear both sides and finish it in a hot oven), quick and hot, just enough to sear the outside and get the inside to medium rare. Let it rest, lay it on your cutting board, and look for the grain. It will look kind of like |||| running one direction through the meat. You want to cut your slices so your blade is at a 45* angle from the board and you're cutting across those grains at a 45* angle (That's two 45* angles -- one the knife's perspective relative to the board like a miter saw, the other the knife's perspective relative to how it's intersecting the grains in the meat). Hold your knife so that from the side it looks like a backslash (""\""). Cut thin. Save all the juices and bits of rub that accumulate, and dump them and all the meat in a bowl and toss -- you'll see that the meat sucks up everything it gave up. Try a slice. It's juicy, tender, flavorful. 

I cannot stress to you the importance of these points -- choose the right meat, cook it right, rest (REST IT!), then slice it appropriately. You'll be amazed at how much a difference you'll notice just in any one of these choices. You don't even need to season the steak past a fat sprinkle of salt on both sides and these four choices will [revolutionize your burritos](http://gifs.gifbin.com/reverse-1232550555_mexican%20trippin.gif). You'll end up resenting the vegetables and tortilla for wasting belly space that could have been taken up by more meat.

When using chicken, just stir-fry it -- slice it like I describe above, season it, heat up a pan, cook it through, then deglaze the pan with some beer and lime (to pick up and coat the chicken pieces with all the yummy brown bits). (I recommend slicing and then cooking the chicken to maximize surface area and even-out the cooking time -- cooking a whole tit in its cylindrical shape minimizes surface area and, since the breast is much thicker in some parts than others, cooks unevenly.) You want slices, not chunks (imagine the difference between layers of easy-to-bite-through slices and big old hunks of chicken meat tumbling out your burrito. 

As for seasoning your meat: you want to rub it with salt and cumin at the very least. Chili or chile powder is a good addition -- preferably that [made entirely of your choice of one dried pepper](http://www.spicesinc.com/p-823-serrano-chile-powder.aspx) (not the ""mixes"" they sell in the seasoning isle) is best. Smoked paprika is another good addition. If you like it extra hot, chop up finely and add one or two [chipotle en adobo](http://www.mexgrocer.com/1349.html?mr:trackingCode=99293CB0-C040-E211-BFCC-001B21A69EB0&amp;mr:referralID=NA&amp;mr:adType=pla&amp;mr:ad=20095067647&amp;mr:keyword=&amp;mr:match=&amp;mr:filter=20607592087&amp;gclid=CLDXpMShxbQCFQeDnQodXwMACQ) and don't forget to include the juice. Lime is your friend -- add lime. I approve of MSG and add the recommended amount to all the meats I cook (unless the recipe already includes high-glutamate items like soy sauce and mushrooms). But, if nothing else, salt and cumin (and lime). The longer it sits the better. 

That above is really all you need for a good steak or chicken burrito -- everything else pales in comparison to the importance of the above. But just in case:

Assuming you're adding onions and peppers, I recommend sweet onions and red or yellow peppers (they're sweeter). Slice them in rings or strips and give them a quick grilling or char in the pan (i.e., a light coat of non-stick spray on a hot pan, little stirring around so they get a little black in spots). Experiment with all those hot peppers supermarkets carry now -- they also like char. If you must use lettuce, get romaine (fuck iceberg) or get bold and try out some thinly sliced red cabbage (fuck yeah, cabbage). Get cilantro up in that bitch. If you're going to do cheese, get real [queso blanco](https://www.karouncheese.com/images/products/92_tn330_KAROUN-queso-blanco-2.jpg) (fuck cheddar and double-fuck ""Mexican blend""). If you're going to use [pico de gallo](https://www.google.com/search?num=10&amp;hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;site=imghp&amp;tbm=isch&amp;source=hp&amp;biw=1272&amp;bih=783&amp;q=pico+de+gallo&amp;oq=pico+de+&amp;gs_l=img.3.0.0l10.1058.2097.0.3345.8.7.0.0.0.0.67.421.7.7.0...0.0...1ac.1.EqJAqX9ApsY), make it from scratch - recipes abound on the internet, and the one ""trick"" is putting the onion and garlic in a wire mesh strainer and pouring boiling salted water over them to take off the raw bite.

We snatched the goods from big restaurant names because their chefs were too lazy to do the trip to the early morning markets. Mexicans filet makers loved us. Fresh vegetables kept their best in their backrooms for us. We ruled LA for three years and sold the darn joint in time before the economic collapse. Because I love reddit, once a week I will give you one of our recipe. Fuck you if you want to hate, enjoy if you find these recipe attractive. These recipe will need passion and work. Not for the faint of heart. Oh, also, my grammar sucks, because English is my second language. So for those grammar Nazi, please go suck a dick. Here's my first recipe for you my dear reddit:

Spaghetti alla Bolognese

The secret of all good French and Italian sauce –and why you guys get heart burns all the time in the US – is a good stock. In the US, most restaurant is fucking you by doing cheap beef stock you wouldn't want to see how it is made, so there is may stock:

Veal stock:

Get three big bones of veal. I don't care how you find the darn thing. Kill it yourself for all I care, just get some darn veal bones. Pick a large Aluminum or stainless steal bowl. Put the bone in it with marrow showing. Usually neck bones are the best. Add a pinch of rock salt, two tablespoons of your best olive oil, black pepper grounded coarsely and fresh thyme. Don't even read further if the thyme is not fresh. Just don't . Forget it. Oh, you have fresh thyme? OK. You can go on. Now get some real garlic. Not that “made in China” shit that composed 90% of what in your supermarket (I'm not shitting you, 90% of the garlic you find in your store are now made in China. Half of it grown with human waste. You can send a nice thank you letter to the FDA if you wish). OK, now you have the right fucking garlic. Cut it nicely like uncle Pauli, meaning super thin. Cut 4 buds. Toss it in the bowl with everything I said earlier. Watch your fucking hands like you are going to operate someone. Done? OK. Now mix the whole thing in the bowl with your hand.

Now set the oven like it is hell inside, 450 F, no less. Put the content of the bowl in a cast Iron pot with no enamel, like cowboy style. Put it in the oven. Cook 35 minutes. The house should smell like an Italian girl comes in your house and suddenly want to have sex.

You should stay on this so don't do anything else until those bones are done.

OK, now. Peel 4 large carrots, some gorgeous stuffs. Not the stuff you buy with food stamps. Two nice leeks. Yeah, the cashier will ask you what the hell this is, guaranteed, and you'll tell her, “you know, there is more than chicken and beef out there!”... anyway... cut the leeks along the length and clean it thoroughly (sand love to stick on those). Two branches of celery only. Two large white onions, the kind to make a grown man cry. Cut them only in half. Half a cup of tomato paste. (the ingredients should read: “Tomatoes”, and nothing else, no salt, no sugar, nothing else. Those are out there, I get them all the time even in the shittiest store; just learn how to read. Usually they have Italian name. Just don't do Heinz). Six whole pepper seeds, two cloves. A huge bunch of curly parsley, half a lemon with its skin, half a pound of Crimini/ Italian brown mushrooms. Fresh fucking thyme, a lot. Put all this in two gallons of water in a very large pot. Toss the bone inside with a good piece of smoke pork belly or a nice piece of bacon (but not too big as to overpower the veal. Remember, it's a veal stock, not a pork stock, ok?). Mix a bit. Boil for a hour. Simmer for four hours. Kill the fire. Keep the liquid. Throw everything else. Yes. Do it. Those vegetables and meats have given to the liquids everything they had, their taste, their soul, everything; even if they still look good, they are pointless to eat. Now your veal stock is ready. You can save it for two weeks. Beef stock can be saved a mere four days. Fish stock only two days. Chicken stock three days top. I know this well: these are the regulations that if you break them causes the state inspectors to close your joint!

All right. Now you have your stock that took you a whole fucking Saturday to do, and you are ready to have that Italian chick on Sunday for a great Bolognese and even better sex.

Start with one nice big onion cut in small cubes in grape seed oil. Not olive oil. Grape seed oil is also an Italian (and French) thing. It has not cholesterol, no polyunsaturated fats, and has no taste. So all the ingredients you cook stays genuine in flavor. It's a bit pricey but it kept on going until 400F before burning. In other words, that oil is from the Gods, and the US corporate food hates it and never uses it. So it must be good.. Meanwhile, crush four canned anchovies in a small bowl. I know you American won't like it, but I promise you: you will never feel nor taste it, it's just like a natural MSG that, if you don't tell anyone, no one will notice, but it does make a hell of a difference in the deepness of the overall taste. Now saute the onion in a large, I mean large a pan, 12 inch minimum. The largest the pan is, the more the water can evaporate and the brown crisp can develop beautifully everywhere.

Half way until brown put the anchovies with the onion and mix... yes...i know... it will smell horrendous in the first minute.. like some bad smelly socks.. full of ammonia.. ... yes... I know.... but then things starts to transform and the smell becomes amazing... well, maybe you'll find out after a dozen try, anyway. Now, put your grounded beef, grounded veal and grounded pork, equal parts. For 4 persons? Try half a pound of each. If you can't find ground veal, do half beef half pork. That's all right. You will just miss on something extraordinary, but you can keep on reading. Anyway, now the fishy smell should be gone. Toss in it one full garlic clove minced. Mix well on full fire. Add one full tablespoon of salt, same with black pepper.

When all the meat seems cooked and the proteins starts developing into an inconvenient crust at the bottom it is time for the wine to come singing. Red. Dry! One full cup to start. OK... I forgot something... Have this cup of wine hot on the side. You don't want to stop the cooking process by pouring cold wine on the meat! So heat up the wine just 4~5 minutes before doing this. Now pour the how wine on the meat and toss a pinch of coriander in it. The latter kills the taste of alcohol and leaves the warm taste of the wine intact. Whatever... just, put a pinch of the darn thing. Deglaize. Now the wine is almost absorbed, add a full cup of veal stock. Cover. Cook for 30 minutes.

Open it up. Now it is smelling like fucking heaven and the Italian girl is really all over you. Hold her up by pouring more wine in her glass and come back to the stove. Put your dick on your hear, you'll smoke it later. Now, open a big can of magnificent crush tomatoes and toss it in the sauce. You don't need to add more tomato paste (hey, the sauce does not need to be this fucking “red” like corporate food wants you to believe. Taste it, you'll understand) Mix well. Add a nice bunch of big basil leaves in it. If you want to add great quality mushrooms, or some oil infused with it, here's the time. Cover again. Add a cube of unsalted butter. Don't ask why. Cook 20 minutes more on low fire.

Kill the whole thing. Keep it covered. Cooked your spaghetti the heck you want it to be done. Toss with the sauce in a way the pasta does not swim in it, with fresh grated dry Italian cheese on top. Cut some parley thin and reserve for the final touch on the plate on top of the cheese. Serve with a burgundy or a top notch Californian Pinot noir, and Crispy Italian bread. Have the girl feeding you.""",MSG,panga,11,Cooking,2012-05-12 21:08:21 UTC,5,2012

However I think much like serving foods with nuts in them at dinner parties, would you want to risk that for your friends?

"That is a good start.  Weekly, buy beans, chicken, eggs, pasta, bread, cheese, yogurt milk cereal and tons of fresh fruits, and veggies.  Get managers special(old) cuts of non-chicken meat and freeze it right away.  Every so often stock up on staples like flour, oil, butter, baking soda/powder, corn starch, peanut butter, rice, spices, sauces condiments.

Get a big pan and some (non-microwave) popcorn.

Buy some raw peanuts, put em in a cookie sheet and cook them at 350 for 15 mins then gently shake the pan and give em 15 more minutes.  Fresh peanuts are amazing.

Beans could be a weekly or occasional staple purchase the same with potatoes, cereal and peanut butter.  They are so cheap but can last so long.

I try to go all natural but I buy taco powder (in a big container not envelopes) and cheese powder (for the popcorn it comes in all sorts of flavors.) and those contain MSG.

For the veggies I would suggest frozen peas, broccoli, cauliflower, carrots and corn.  For fresh; cucumber, carrots, broccoli cauliflower tomatoes avocado celery and peppers.

For the fruit apples, (tons of) bananas (until you can't stand them), oranges and the occasional fresh berry (and frozen berries which are cheaper unless it's the season).

Don't forget mushrooms they are expensive per pound but a pound of mushrooms is huge. Crimini white or if on sale Portabella are the way I go.

For produce try to stay under $3.00 per pound unless you have a big influx of cash.  I shoot for  $1.00 a pound but that isn't always feasible.

You want mostly produce.  You can change out bread for tortillas they can be more expensive but they add some versatility.  Read your labels.  You want as little fake crap as possible.  Don't do diet or low fat anything it's fake garbage (I do get diet Dr. Thunder but he's a doctor.)  If you need to lighten up your diet fill up on fruits and veggies. When buying yogurt (or if you splurge cottage cheese).  Read the labels they fill those full of so much fake crap.

I feed my self and my pregnant wife on $45 a week.  About once a month I spend $100 getting staples (and probably other crap too.)

Obviously you can't get everything here for $45 all at once but it gives variety.  So you have to toy with it.  Figure out milk, egs, meat, cheese and bread cost then go buy the rest in produce.

"This recipe has been floating around on the internet for years and, while it might taste good, it's not going to taste like Chick-Fil-A's nuggets.  For one thing, there's no sugar and that's what lends the sweetness to Chick-Fil-A's products.

You can see the real ingredient list [here](http://www.chick-fil-a.com/Food/Menu-Detail/ChickfilA-Nuggets#?details=ingredients), but basically it's:

Chicken breast  
seasoning (salt, monosodium glutamate, sugar, spices, paprika)  
Milk wash (water, egg, nonfat milk)  
seasoned coating (flour, sugar, salt, monosodium glutamate, nonfat milk, baking soda, spice, soybean oil, paprika)

Any recipe that doesn't include those ingredients, particularly the MSG and sugar, is not going to taste like what Chick-Fil-A sells.

And don't even get me started on the stupid rumor that they supposedly marinate their chicken in pickle juice.  I had a GF who read that and decided to try the recipe that was given.  Suffice to say that chicken marinated in pickle juice is pretty nasty.  Even the dog refused to eat it.

For fried rice:

Steam rice at least an hour beforehand (or the day before) and spread it out on a tray and refrigerate to dry it out a bit. Use a long grain rice.

Your basic pork fried rice has peas, eggs, spring onions, and BBQ pork. Have all your ingredients prepared before you begin.

Start by scrambling eggs. Use ~1-2 eggs per cup of rice. When the eggs are almost cooked, but still slightly runny, add the rice and a little more oil. Keep frying until the rice is mostly cooked. You can add the salt at this stage. For that authentic restaurant taste, you're going to have to add MSG. Use about as much MSG as salt.

Add the peas and pork and finish cooking the rice. You can add soy sauce if you want but be careful about the salt. When it's cooked add the spring onions and give it a quick stirfry to mix it in. Done.

"If you ever go into authentic Chinese restaurants, they often have disclaimers about allergies. I've outgrown my asthma, but one thing can give me an asthma attack and that's too much MSG in a meal.

The only thing more perplexing to me than the militant anti-MSG folk are the militant pro-MSG folk such as yourself.

It really is a moot point for seasoning. If you asked a decent chef the difference between that and fleur de sel, especially the clay salt they have in Okinawa, they will tell you there is a huge difference and they are right.

The problem with your thesis is that if you cook the same Asian dishes you're talking about, except with a very good salt, you'll find the same umami sensation. It's why you put salt in chocolate chip cookies. It's about understanding balance.

MSG requires no skill, understanding and applying seasoning does. And the reason your friend likes the taste more is that our mineral salt is not very good and we don't use a lot of seasonings. You might use white pepper, black pepper, fivespice, msg and salt in an Asian dish all at once. It's not that MSG is better, it's that things are seasoned differently there. We are a neophyte culture when it comes to seasoning.

IMO, MSG should mainly be used with pork and beef when you are pairing it with a sweet sauce. Everything else benefits from proper seasoning and a decent sea salt. I use MSG when I am lazy.",MSG,smacksaw,7,Cooking,2011-01-21 09:16:01 UTC,1,2011

"I've eaten rice at nearly every meal my entire life, one of the hazards of having a Japanese mother.  Yet even now, when I make fried rice with soy sauce, I couldn't tell you how much to use.  I just make sure that the pan is hot enough that when the soy gets down to the metal itself, it steams.  And I just pour, fold, pour, fold...  until it gets to a color I like, and then I will taste a bit of it.

Use short grain rice.  Long grain rice sucks, and I guess Chinese restaurants use it because it is cheap. But steam your short grain rice (not too soft, if anything, use just a hair less water in your steamer when you make it).  

The way I make fried rice is kind of like this.  I cook my meat in a pan with oil in it (maybe 1-3 tablespoons, depending on the type of meat), once it is done I will drain the oil from the meat off of the pain (like say...  bacon grease.  Drier meats, like pork doesn't need this), I will add egg (if I want egg in it), then any vegetables that I might want to add, and give it just a minute (until the egg is done).  I make sure there is still some visible oil in there, to coat the rice.  When the rice is in the pan, you just steady move it (season it too, salt/pepper/msg/usually garlic powder), so it doesn't get hot enough to cook the rice itself more on the bottom of the pan.  *Then* you just start mixing in your soy sauce, and it should steam a fair bit and put out a hell of a good soy aroma when it hits the bottom of the pan.  But the rice should only be in the pan before you pull it for a couple of minutes, just remember that the rice is already cooked.

About my favorite combo for making a soy fried rice is pork &amp; shrimp.  I will add egg into it, green onions, later add the rice, and lastly the soy last. ",msg,bluequail,2,recipes,2012-01-05 03:47:50 UTC,1,2012
"Wok at maximum heat (smoke everywhere, roommates/girlfriend/etc freaking out), minimal oil, rice at least half a day old, dried out slightly and if possible slightly 'under-cooked' with too little water. Jasmine rice (sometimes called Thai fragrant rice) is the best variety to fry imo. If your wok is no good then you can make decent fried rice with a -large- nonstick frying pan; a good pan is better than a bad wok, I'd say.

Thai light/white soy sauce is my secret for perfect fried rice. I don't really measure but I add the rice to the wok before anything else (many recipes call for garlic first; with the wok this hot you would not be able to do this as it would burn instantly), once rice is hot add egg, then probably about half and half salt and soy, white and/or black pepper, msg. I either have it plain like that + or - spring onion garnish, or go full Thai-style and add shallots just after the rice, some cooked meat or Asian sausage etc., and finish with lime juice, white pepper and chili.

"This is off the top of my head but I'll make it easy for you. 

The easiest way to end up with the stock is if you want brisket and tendons in your final noodle dish. The leftover braising liquid IS the broth.

Start with roughly 5lb of even layered Brisket (layered is important) and 1lb of tendon. Add 2 small onions, 4 pieces of ginger, 4 inch cinnamon stick, 4 cloves, 4 star anise, and 4 tbsp of fish sauce. Some people add beef bones to this process or start the braising with beef stock but, you can cheat if you throw in one or two cubes of beef bouillon.  Skim periodically to ensure a clear broth (keeping at simmer also helps).

Add cold water to cover and simmer for about 4-5 hours or until brisket/tendons are tender but not falling apart/melted, extract the brisket and tendons and let cool/refrigerate momentarily. Season with additional salt and brown/cane sugar, then strain the liquid.

OR alternatively, search your Asian grocer for a packet of Vietnamese Pho Soup Base, it exists but doesn't make sense if you are going to be braising brisket/tendons anyway.


The reason why you refrigerate your the tendons/brisket is so that you can slice it properly, it's hard to do thinly without a slicer, so try your best. You can ""shape"" the tendons by wrapping them in plastic wrap while they're hot and putting some weight on them to give them that squared off look.

Use flat rice noodles, soak them in warm water while you are making your stock. They come in 3-4 different thicknesses, if you choose the thin ones, you can pour salted boiling water on them and let it steep for 4-5 minutes and they will be fine. Thicker ones will need to be boiled, use the cooking directions on the packet. If you cook it too long, it will turn into mushy glue.

Fresh ingredients include: Bean Sprouts, Thai Basil, Thinly Sliced Onion (soaked in water), Lime, Sliced Beef, Thai Bird Chilies.

For the sliced beef, you might be able to get hotpot/sukiyaki beef from your Asian grocer, or if you don't have access to one, ask your butcher to freeze a mid grade cap/bone off rib eye. If can slice a fresh rib eye that thin with knives, then well, you're a pro.

After that, everything is just assembly.
Put the noodles in bowls immediately into bowls after they reach desired tenderness. Assemble your beef brisket, tendon, and rare beef on top, add sliced onions, green onion, then pour BOILING soup either directly onto the rare beef if you like it cooked, aim for the noodles if you prefer rare.  Add your bean sprouts, lime and basil prior to eating.

Pro Tips: Don't be afraid of using LOTs of fish sauce (salt), if you look up any nutritional review of any pho any restaurant has served, the sodium is off the charts; use it when boiling the noodles, also use it for when you're seasoning your broth. Keep everything hot, warmed bowls, hot noodles, boiling broth and don't cheap out on the soup. The worst thing is warm cold noodles drawing down the temperature of the broth so that the entire meal becomes lukewarm.

I've long since forgone making my own soup, as premade Pho Soup Base has MSG in it, so no matter how good I make it, I can't beat the Umami of the MSG, Google image search will give you a visual on what many brands look like.

"Technically his equivalency is a bit off, but the fact remains that MSG is made of sodium and glutamate which are both naturally occurring in many foods.  Therefore, judicious use is no different than adding in a glutamate rich food and some salt.

However, he is wrong about the exact equivalency he gave.  The number of grams of a substance cannot be taken directly from a pseudo-volume measure like a teaspoon, but most sources claim a tsp = 3-6 grams so we'll say a 1/2 tsp = 2 grams in this example.  [This](http://www.umamiinfo.com/2011/03/umami-rich-food-vegetables.php/) source has glutamate from tomatoes at 250mg/100g of tomato and [this](http://www.tomatom.com/2008/12/are-you-a-happy-little-glutamate/) source has it at 150 mg/100 g.  So for the sake of this example we will use 200 mg of glutamate /100 g of tomato.

So how much glutamate do we need to get the equivalent of 1/2 tsp worth of MSG?  Glutamate has a molar mass of 147 g/mol and sodium's is 23 g/mol.  Thus glutamate is 86% of the mass of MSG (147/170x100).  At 2 grams of MSG in a teaspoon, we need 1.7 g of glutamate (2x86%/100%).  According to our source of 200 mg of glutamate/ 100 g of tomato we need just under a kilo of tomatoes (850 g) to get the necessary glutamate.  This would probably be more like 4 large tomatoes according to [this](http://nutritiondata.self.com/facts/vegetables-and-vegetable-products/2682/2).  Also you would be adding less sodium than 1/2 tsp of salt because MSG is only 14% sodium while table salt is 40% sodium.  So, while the example was technically wrong its message still is correct.

"It it tastes bland, it's probably not salty enough or not sour enough. 
Beginners are often too careful with salt, since they only know what it does when
they directly apply it to their food (e.g. an egg). But if you use it for pasta, you will throw away most of the salt with the water, so you need to use a lot of it.
As a reference, if I cook 300g of Spaghetti with 3 liters of water, I use about a tablespoon of salt. 
Also, monosodium glutamate helps to bring out the flavor of the minced meat (and anything savory, really). I have never used pure MSG, but it occurs naturally in many types of food, such at tomatoes, parmesan, grilled meat etc.
So when you cook minced meat, I suggest that you add a good amount of tomato paste, as it is basically concentrated flavor. When you are not sure about the right amount of salt during cooking, put some of the sauce in a separate bowl and play around with salt &amp; spices there, so you don't mess up the whole pot. ;-)",monosodium glutamate,BarneyStinson,2,Cooking,2012-12-20 16:25:45 UTC,12,2012

"Salads:  dead simple a lot of times and very good for you.  Lettuce, spinach, tomatoes, onions, olives, carrots, cabbage, mushrooms, etc, etc.  Chop it up, add dressing and presto.  Hell, a salad for me a lot of times is cucumber chunks, lemon juice, salt, and chili powder.

Oatmeal: Oats, milk or water, raisins, cinnamon, and apple slices.  Throw everything into a pot, except perhaps the apples.  Boil it and then simmer it covered mostly until it looks good.  Add more liquid if you think it's too dry.

""Fries"":  Cut potatoes or sweet potatoes up into chunks or wedges, throw them on a baking sheet.  Throw on some olive oil, salt and pepper, then put them in a 300-400 F oven for a while.  Extra bonus points if you add cheese towards the end of cooking them.  I'm not sure how cheese would work on sweet potatoes though.  But hey, it never hurts to experiment and I'll probably give that a shot now asap.

Burgers:  Should be a no brainer mostly aside from the patties?  I like salmon as it can be excellent and is probably pretty healthy for you.  A can of wild caught salmon, egg or two, bread crumbs, dijon mustard, some herbs and spices.  Mix all that together and fry it up in olive oil.  Not too long as you don't want to dry it out so much.

""Stir fry"":  basically anything goes here, but an Americanized stir fry might be something like onions, carrots, bean sprouts, and ground pork.  Throw stuff in a skillet with some cooking oil and fry it up.  You want your veggies cooked but still crispy mostly, so start with the meat (and dried chilis!) and do not over cook the veggies.  Also the meat is mainly for flavor so use it sparingly.  Season with some soy sauce, salt, pepper, rice vinegar, and sesame oil.  A typical way for me to cook spinach involves just oil, garlic, spinach, pepper, and sometimes vinegar.  EDIT: corn starch at the end if you want to thicken it up a tad.

That's off the top of my head.  I'll probably think up some other junk here in a few.

More:

Stock:  Onions, garlic, carrots, celery, mushrooms, etc.  You could go nuts on the veggies.  Also spices like salt, pepper, rosemary, junk like that, there can be multiple variations.  Keep it simple though at first and don't add too much, perhaps 1/2 onion, 2 cloves garlic, a carrot or two, and salt and pepper to taste.  Cover that with water, add some chicken/beef/lamb, and boil it for a bit.  Strain it if you want the straight broth.  Simply remove bones from the chicken if you're going for a soup later on.

Soups/stews:  This is one thing out of many that your stock can be used for.  Mexican and Asian soups tend to pair cinnamon with beef and I have to say I'm a big fan.  Pho is one example, and birria I believe is another.  Do the cinnimon nuttiness during your stock phase of course, but again, start out simple, so forget cinnamon altogether to begin with.  Try and make something simple like chicken noodle soup.  Me, I'm a big fan of Asian style breakfast soups (some would call it porridge I guess).  Chicken or seafood stock, rice, and veggies, the variations are endless.  Mine turned out spectacular the other day:  fatty pork (sorry, say no to bacon on this, or please say yes and let me know how it goes) with a boat load of fish sauce (careful here, a boatload to you might be a few drops, but I think I went 3 TB in a reall small pan), fresh minced ginger, onions, and sugar, covered in water and simmered until tender.  I added to that a ton of rice and dried chilis.  Heaven.

Slightly less nutty Asian breakfast soup, for the less fish sauce inclined:  rice, chicken stock, onions, and any greens you have on hand, from spinach to lettuce to etc.  Throw it all together, cook until done, remove from heat and drop an egg or two in it.  Blah blah blah, yeah, thicken it up with corn starch, swirl it around and only add egg whites or something so you get the crazy egg drop soup swirl look?  I'm too lazy.  Anyhow, garnish with cilantro perhaps?

Spanish rice:  Go with brown rice I say.  2 to 1 ratio of rice to broth roughly.  No need to be too exacting, but if you want to be I'm sure you could look some precise recipe junk up online.  Start out with some butter, salt, and onions frying up in a soup pan.  Add minced garlic, perhaps some spices like cumin, and uncooked rice after the onions soften up a tad.  Add a jalepeno or habanero or bell pepper or something at this point.  Add a tomato or two or three after a few mins.  Add the chicken stock.  Bring to a boil, simmer, and somewhat follow the rice package's cooking times.  Cilantro is a must add at the end, and perhaps you'll want to try lime juice too.

Pan fried chicken:  Coat your chicken in a mix of flour, lots of salt (or not so much if you're not trying to go KFC style.  Perhaps some MSG is in order if you do like KFC?), and lots of hot pepper and dried chili.  If you're looking for 21 original spices, look it up online, but I think salt is the key ingredient with peppers and chilis being a close second.  Anyway, get a frying pan, add 1/8 of an inch of oil.  Do not use too much as you're not exactly deep frying the junk.  And don't go too hot on the heat as again you're not exactly deep frying the junk.  Cook it uncovered for a good long while until it looks good.  Hopefully you did it right and it's crispy and not too oily on the outside and actually cooked on the inside.  If not, rinse repeat.  I've found 3-4 on my electric stove works nicely.  Your stove may vary.

TLDR?  I think a major point you should get out of my post is this:  Just start cooking.  Find some foods you like and experiment with making them.  Yeah, it's going to turn out god awful some times.  Or at least I'm no prodigy and it certainly does on my end.  But I can definitely say I'm getting better at it.

"[Maggi seasoning sauce](http://www.maggi.com.au/products/asian-sauces/seasoning). I resisted buying it for years, but it is amazing.

"It really depends on your concept of healthy and easy is.

I feel that stir fries, as long as they don't use a ton of oil and thickened sauce is healthy.  I feel easy is something that I can cook &lt;15min.

For something less Asian-ish: oil, garlic, green leafy veg, a little water, salt, ajinomoto/msg(if you're okay with that sort of thing).  Protein frying in another pan.  If you're okay with waiting a little longer, you could wait till your protein is done and cook your veggies in there.  Something like chicken with spinach(you could add mushrooms, tomato, shallots).

That is pretty much the quickest way to go about things.  Steaming/boiling/baking take significantly more time, but less immediate attention.  Another good option is to just make a batch of something, like Japanese curry, and reheat it during the week.  Basically anything braised/stewed is a good choice.  Even if you only have a braised protein that needs reheating, it'll save you time and energy when you need it most.  Once you have a braised protein, all you need to do is saute some veggies.

"I am Taiwanese and grew up in a heavily Asian city/region of Southern California, but I live in a place that lacks both quality and quantity in terms of Asian food. I make it a personal mission when visiting home to drop by a Ranch 99 or similar Chinese/Asian market (the Japanese chain in Southern California is called Mitsuwa, and it's a pretty large one) and stock up on what I like to call Apocalyptic Soup Reserves. My usual haul looks something like this:

* 1-2 2.5oz bottles of Hon-dashi granulated fish stock (Ajinomoto brand) - this is prepared from bonito and is not something you want if you believe MSG is bad for you. I love MSG so there you go. This shit is essential in my drunk-must-have-something-in-10-minutes cookery. It's basically instant soup stock and also acts as seasoning (salt).
* 1 20oz bottle of soy paste (usually Kimlan), either regular or spicy. This is exactly what it sounds like: a thick soy sauce with the consistency of... BBQ sauce? It has a slight sweetness and not nearly as much salinity as regular soy. It adds color and obviously salt to soup stock.
* 1 12oz container of fermented chili bean paste. I have no idea what brand to recommend except to say they are all pretty good. This is to add depth and heat to a soup stock. It's pretty good as a condiment for anything, really. Alternatively, you can get the stuff that looks like satanic red orange oil with a bunch of chili flakes swirling around in it. It's a popular table side condiment at Chinese restaurants.
* 2-3 12oz containers of chili bamboo shoots. These are pickled bamboo shoots sitting in chili sesame oil. The shoots are delicious, but the oil is also very much usable for anything.
* 1-2 8oz containers of zha cai, or Chinese pickles. They are frigging delicious and are the traditional condiment for my favorite meal in the world: Taiwanese beef noodle soup. (I make it probably once every three months. It's not that hard, I just don't have much fridge or freezer space). Any pickle is a good choice but these are my favorite.
* 3-6 packages of frozen dumplings, the cheaper the better because frankly I have yet to encounter any that are bad, just some that are pretty good. These will seriously cost you maybe $5 for a package of like 30-40 dumplings if you look for the stuff that's on sale. I prefer the simple pork and leek ones myself. These are wonderfully cheap and easy substitutes for buying/preparing protein yourself, and obviously they keep well. Just make sure to chill during your drive home because once slightly defrosted they have a tendency to stick to each other.
*White pepper. So simple, and so essential for me.
*Rice wine vinegar. Seasoned or not, not really too big of a difference for this purpose.
* 2-3 3-6lbs packages of dry noodles, preferably medium width. (Just my opinion.) This is the most important part, but also the part I change the most if that makes sense. Basically any good Asian market will have a huge selection of noodles. They will be branded in their chosen language (everyone makes good noodles so don't be afraid to try Korean or Vietnamese or whatever), and it'll probably be pretty confusing. I try as many different brands and makes as possible simply because they are so very cheap. A single 5lb package of noodles is probably about $6-$8. Right now I have been buying a lot of Well Luck products and they are treating me right. Here's a [catalog](http://s230968237.onlinehome.us/product.php?id=13&amp;b=on&amp;page=5) (I've been getting the Gourmet Master brand). You can certainly get ""fresh"" noodles in wet packs (like udon), but dry noodles are so very stackable and really almost impervious to any kind of fucking up.

OK, so that may seem like a lot but if you seriously eat it twice a day everyday the above haul should probably last you at least a month if not two or three, depending on noodle portion size. And the above should cost somewhere in the realm of $35-$50. In no way did I actually perform any rigorous math here so don't hold me to it.

So basically you now have a larder of Asian noodle soup ingredients that won't take up much room and can be made in whatever amount of time it takes to boil water plus 5-8 minutes for the noodles/dumplings. The above are my basics, but obviously you can include things like pickled ginger, nori (seaweed sheets), dried shrimp or scallop (they are edible but mainly there for flavor), fish cake (a delicious Japanese concoction found in ramen and made from burdock, usually), etc. Aaaand here we go:

1. Think about how simple or complex you want it. If you want greens, just remember to buy some spinach/scallions/napa cabbage/whatever works in a soup and have it in your fridge. If you want added flavor depth, keep some garlic and ginger around. (When I am drunk I do not have the patience to peel garlic and ginger, so I sometimes just smash the shit out of it and toss it in the water I've reserved for the soup and then strain.) Nothing beats a stock made from meaty pork bones, kombu and tare, strained and then even clarified, but obviously this thread is not about that. If you have stock around, awesome. Not entirely necessary though. Basically having a few bits of produce can really help out a meal from an aesthetic and nutritional viewpoint. I personally dig on bean sprouts and cilantro. I will often buy pork or beef and roast it to about rare or mid-rare, let it sit and then off to the fridge. When ready just slice and add in and watch til your doneness is approached. Any protein works, but for convenience I like to par cook so I'm not dealing with multiple pans every day.
2. Eggs. Have them. Drop them into the soup pot and depending on how you like them you will either have a soft poached delight or if you thought ahead hard boiled awesomeness. The whites will add body to a soup naturally and a soft yolk is nature's most perfect sauce.
3. Keep your soup pot and noodle pot separate. Unless you know your noodle timing and/or want increased starch presence in the soup. Some days I like clear broth, and some days I don't. I also tend to salt my boiling noodle water heavily. If you're like me and you don't have a huge pot at home then the water will boil over; keeping soup and noodles separate during the cooking is a good way of avoiding soup loss from boiling over or absorption during cooking. 
4. Invest in a big bowl. One that is capable of holding at least 3-4 cups (24-32 liquid oz.) is a nice idea. Also get some Asian soup spoons and of course chopsticks, unless you don't like chopsticks. Asian supermarkets have all of this for staggeringly low prices.
5. When in doubt, test a noodle every 30 seconds after four-five minutes at full boil. There is a sweet spot but I think for a lot of Asians it's just a little past al dente. Not toothy, but firm.

OK, now on to the actual process.

1. Run that tap. Hot tap water equals less time waiting for a boil.
2. Get two pots on, one for the noodles and one for the soup. Salt the noodle water. (Don't be gentle, but don't dump half a cup in there either.) Add whatever amount of soup water you'd like, plus maybe 2oz more to accommodate loss.
3. If you have garlic, ginger, onion or anything that takes a bit of time to cook put that in the soup pot first. (Obviously the smaller the cut the faster the cook.) Any greenery like spinach or scallions that takes little time can be added last, or even into the bowl directly. (This applies to any herb used. Don't add cilantro, basil etc. until ready to eat.)
4. Start making that soup. If you have veg/chicken/pork/etc. stock obviously you'd use that either in replacement of or in conjunction with water. Add the hon-dashi. It's just like salt in terms of amount. It will give the water a slightly beige color. Add soy paste or soy sauce if using. Add whatever amount of spice from fermented chili soy bean or similar flavoring. Add a dash or two of vinegar or an acid. It brightens up the soup and makes something that would normally be just salty into something better. You should never boil a broth/stock, so once you get there reduce heat and let it simmer. Adjust seasoning to your tastes. If too salty either add water or, if you're lucky enough to have it on hand, a peeled potato. 
5. Add noodles to boiling water. If using dumplings, I find it's easiest to put them into the soup pot because you don't know if the noodle and dumpling cooking time will sync. Frozen dumplings are done when they've been floating for a few minutes. Test one if unsure.
6. After about 5-8 minutes noodles should be done. Put a colander in the sink. Increase heat on the soup pan and add eggs/additional greens/par cooked meat. When done, strain the noodles. Put strained noodles into your bowl. Stand back and admire.
7. Splash noodles with either oil or some of the soup so they don't stick to each other.
8. When the stuff in the soup pot is done to your liking dump the contents into the bowl and onto the noodles. (Be careful with medium and soft eggs.) By now you will have some understanding of whether you made the ""right"" ratio of noodles to soup. I like a heaping pile of noodles with just enough soup to barely not cover. You may be different.
9. Garnish with herbs, pickled stuff, etc. If you have/like sriracha/hoisin, go to town.
10. Have intercourse with your food. Because that's what it'll look like to everyone else.

If done right this should take about 10-15 minutes, and you'll really only have to clean two pots, one knife and a cutting board. And of course your bowl and utensils. I have also omitted everything else except water, hon-dashi, soy sauce and noodles and, while not the most elegant of meals it did get me through the night. Taking a few extra steps to have the above will make a difference, though.

"**Roast chicken, sandwiches, salad, and soup all from one bird**
Buy a whole chicken, reserve the neck. Roast it with whatever recipe you find on the internet, there are tons. I'd suggest one where you butterfly it and save the spine, reserve it along with the neck. Cut off the tiny little wing tips (the parts that you never eat) and reserve as well.

Enjoy your first chicken dinner. When you're done, carve up the chicken and remove all the meat, saving all of the bones and reserve them. You can use large pieces of leftover chicken as leftover meals, but those tiny little shreds and chunks work great for sandwiches and chicken salad.

Next you can make a kickass soup out of the remaining parts you saved. These instructions will be long, but if you learn the process well it only takes about 15 minutes of work and 1.5 hours total cook time. Get a large pot hot with a bit of oil in it and brown any remaining meat including the chicken wing tips and neck meat. Remove from pot, add a quartered onion, halved carrot, and halved stalk of celery. Sweat with a touch of kosher salt until the onions are translucent. Add back all chicken, including the spine, bones/carcass, and add water until there's 1"" on top. Add 1 bay leaf and a pinch of thyme.

Bring to a boil, then lower to a simmer. Place the pot slightly off center on the burner, this will cause a convection current that causes ""scum"" to collect on one side of the pot. Use a spoon (or better an actual soup skimmer) to skim scum/excess fat off the top periodically. Simmer for at least 1 hour, the chicken carcass and spine should be totally falling apart.

Strain out solids and at this point you have the base of a super yummy soup. There's probably a ton of tiny shreds of meat just falling off the neck/carcass of the chicken, so add those back to the pot. At this point I add either egg noodles, wild rice, or pearled barley. Egg noodles only take 8 minutes to cook in simmering soup, the others take about an hour. I like to add in a chopped carrot, a chopped stalk of celery, and a minced clove of garlic about 15 minutes before the soup is done.

When the soup is just about done I add a bunch of frozen peas (they should be just heated through and turn bright green -- too long and they'll go gross and brown). In a separate bowl I whisk up 1 egg yolk and using a ladle temper in some of the hot soup stock, then incorporate it back into the soup -- this thickens it slightly and improves the soup texture/meatiness. Season slightly with salt, possibly a pinch of MSG, and season lightly with something acidic (often overlooked). White wine vinegar and lemon juice work well.

This makes awesome leftovers. If you use any grains/noodles, they'll suck up more moisture when refrigerated so make sure to top up the liquid level with some chicken stock (store bought is fine) before reheating.

**Tunisian Chickpea Soup**
Not my recipe, so I'll just link: http://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/02/health/nutrition/02recipehealth.html

Buy dried chickpeas in bulk, they cost almost nothing. The potentially expensive ingredients here are harissa and preserved lemons -- both of which are crazy cheap to make on your own.

Google up ""no knead bread"". Seriously, you can make great bread for near-zero cost and near-zero work. Dress up a grilled cheese sandwich with some of your leftover chicken, some mustard, and serve with some leftover chicken soup...

**Learn how to braise inexpensive cuts of beef**

But I wouldn't bother with the fancy cut of meat he recommends. For stretching your dollar the furthest you really want to learn what braising means and what meats are best for it. Grocery stores often sell cheap packs of precut ""stewing beef"" that are offcuts that they didn't use for other things. But if there's a big slab of meat on sale for $0.99/lb that is an appropriate cut, jump all over it. You can freeze it too and use it later.

"The way I learned to make fried rice from my mother (yes asian family): The secret is cold rice. Fried rice is best made with long grain rice which has been cooked in a rice cooker. You can use the rice for anything you want the day before. Refrigerate the left over rice to be used for fried rice. This cold consistency will help in the ""frying"" process of the rice, much like how frozen foods are fried to have a specific texture/consistency. For seasoning, many people like to use soy sauce, but you can shy away from the amount of actual soy sauce you add in. The addition of all this extra liquid will make the rice soggy at some point. 

Regular toppings include:
Eggs
Peas
Spam
Cha-Sieu (bbq sweet and sour pork, found in asian butcher shops/dim sum shops
Onion
Green Onion
Garlic
Anything left over (fried rice is a good dish to get rid of ingredients)

To season without the addition of too much soy sauce, we use chicken baste powder. In Asian supermarkets, it's that green cylindrical can with the yellow chicken on front. Soy sauce is good to adjust the color browning of the rice. To avoid the use of MSG in seasoning, it's best to add a small pinch of sugar to bring out the savory flavors in the food. Other than that, use a wok and OP's instructions and ta-da!

Powdered ginger chicken feet: (sorry, couldn't find an English link for you): boil the chicken feet for 5 minutes with a few slices of ginger and several stalks of green onion. Turn off heat for 20 minutes, then pick up a foot and press it to check for tenderness. If it is tender enough for you, then remove the feet from the water and run cold water through feet. Again, boil water, and put in 2.5 packs of powdered ginger, salt to taste, and some Knorr powdered chicken stock (if you like; this is just MSG with chicken flavor mixed in). Add feet, and cook for 3 minutes. Eat one to check for taste; if it's fine, remove, if not, give them another minute or two. Remove from powdered ginger soup, and plate. Serve with a sauce made with half a pack of powdered ginger mix, sesame oil, a pinch of salt, and a few spoons of oil that have been heated (it will cause the powdered ginger mix to sizzle a little).

"Haven't logged in for a while, so I didn't see this comment sooner, but I respectfully disagree that the recipe is a ""poor version of even simple beef stew"" as you put it.

Maybe my grocery store is different than yours, the pre-cut stew beef works just fine for me.  At times, I'll use chuck, bottom round, or any other beef that I happen to be able to get my hands on, and honestly, after 8-10 hours in the crock pot, it's all beef.

As far as the bouillon cubes go, in the recipe it is suggested that you can use canned broth instead if you prefer.  I have used Better than Bouillon base before, and I agree that stuff is great.  However, it's not available everywhere, I can't get it where I am now.  So I'm stuck with bouillon cubes or canned broth.  I don't always have the broth on hand, but I do usually have bouillon cubes/granules.  While I will readily admit that the sodium content is higher than I'd like, there is no MSG in the cubes I use, and they honestly add a nice flavor.  Not all bouillon cubes are created equal, I suppose.

Your other recommendations for cooking are great for someone who has the time to spend in the kitchen browning the meat in small batches, then sauteing the onions, and such.  I'm sure it makes for a great stew, I just usually don't have the time.  This is why I'm much more of a throw it in the crock pot and let it cook on low until I get home kind of person.

"This will require experimentation based on how different my attempts have been on others' kitchen equipment versus my own.  The key is to try to keep the mass dry but cohesive, which is a serious balancing act.  The most basic form is just a portabello mushroom cap, but a basic, cheap recipe for this would be:

Roughly chop two pints of mushrooms, and sweat them with a heavy pinch of salt in a skillet with a small amount of oil over medium, or medium low heat.  When they have reduced in volume by half, put them in a food processor with 1/2 cup of bread crumbs and one egg, pulse until it is relatively homogeneous, but not a paste, about 3 or 4 1-second pulses.  Form into patties and brown each side on the griddle or in a wide non-stick pan.

In experimentation, try adding onion and garlic to the initial sweat, but make sure they're well-minced so you don't want to water-log the mixture.  Add parsley, oregano, and parmesan to the food processor for extra flavor.

"I'm going to assume you mean chinese. It is the mother of all asian cuisines and is the basis of all. Once you have chinese cooking down, you're good.

2 things will make your chinese food, or just asian food in general:

1) Carbon steel or cast iron wok.

2) High heat! Regular household electric stoves or gas burners do not reach temperatures high enough to properly stir fry. So recommended is an outside wok burner.

I own one of these http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9jfgoYIIUs&amp;feature=related

But I recommend this one http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BREZIDI1i9c&amp;feature=related as you can get these types mainly at an restaurant supply store or on amazon.

Little Tips:
-Use only peanut oil as it can withstand the temperature of the heat.
-Always use aromatics in the oil before adding meat or veggies for stir fry (garlic, ginger, peppers, etc.)
-Stir stir stir! Always have some water or broth when stir frying. Just little drops here and there to prevent burning and cook faster.
-Cornstarch and water aka slurry. This will thicken up all your stirfries.
-Use MSG. Yes that MSG. Use it sparingly, but is a an asset in ALL asian cooking.

Find a restaurant that has your favorite asian dish, ask the chef to divulge ingredients (99% of them will be happy to oblige and might even take you in the back to see how it's prepared.) Doesn't hurt to ask! And attempt to perfect it. 

Goodluck on all your cooking endeavors!

"I would stick with the lighter reds like Pinot Noir (as mentioned but its def not ""strong"") And honestly with something as rich as risotto I really enjoy a buttery Chardonnay to cut the super rich texture of the risotto. 

Also, hands down go with something light for dessert after that dinner.

They may not have it where you live, but go to your best wine shop and check. Typically whites will cost you less than reds both in regular wine and ice wine.

"No recipe, because fried rice should never have a recipe. I do have a method. I have two different ways I make it:


**The Normal Way**

Prepare all your ingredients in advance. Make sure the rice is at least room temp, but not hot.

Dump the eggs all at once (unscrambled) into a wok with a tablespoon of oil. Immediately dump the rice and whatever meat you are using and stir it around. Don't wait for the eggs to cook -- the uncooked eggs coats each individual rice grain so it stays separated and helps keep the fried rice from getting too mushy. Season to taste with a dab of oyster sauce, salt and a tiny pinch of sugar. No soy sauce -- it will only make it soggy.


**The OMG I'm craving greasy Chinese food way**

Do the above, except use a lot more oil. A lot, a lot, ALOT. Cook the eggs in enough oil for them to be swimming in it. Dump the rest of the ingredients while the egg is runny, and if it looks like the rice is not getting coated in oil, add more oil until the rice looks shiny. Keep the rice moving in the wok so everything gets coated and fried in oil. Season with salt, a dab of oyster sauce and some MSG. And  no, MSG will not give you a headache.

Was discovered by a Japanese man a century or so ago, found it in seaweed and figured out how to make MSG from it.

Romans liked to use the finest and freshest mackerel and other ""top shelf"" fish to make the stuff with, Vikings and other high-Northerers used (and still use) shark and fish, buried in sand. The process going on is basically a pre-digestion carried out by bacteria, very similar to what's going on in our guts, basically making more bio-available some of the key nutrients and therefore creating something that, while smelling rank n stank, makes our mouths very happy.

"There are some good ideas here. With seasonings, you've got mustard, nutmeg and my favourite, paprika...mix the mustard, but top with the paprika and nutmeg, then...

Panko. Saute it in butter first, then broil it. You don't want to burn the mac and Panko doesn't just broil instantly. Also, I don't use straight panko, but I also use lightly toasted/dried and roughly grated Italian bread.

Pasta. Rigati is the way to go because it holds the sauce. I love to use this:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cavatappi

Make sure you get one that is rigati, aka *ridged* on the outside.

You can also buy no 5 or no 6 macaroni, cook it and then cut it yourself to be longer. Make sure you toss your noodles in butter after you cook them.

I disagree with using any sort of cheese that is above a medium cheddar in your sauce. It's far too oily. You should, however, put a layer of coarsely grated sharp or extra sharp cheddar on top, then seasonings, then breadcrumbs. I also use emmenthal or gruyere in there, but I prefer emmenthal because it's drier. Gruyere is gooier.

I also like to eliminate as much salt as possible and use grana padano, reggiano, etc. This is a very important secret. They contain a sort of ""natural MSG"", which is their saltiness, but also how they amplify other flavours. 

Also, let's not forget to use full 35% cream. Someone mentioned carrageen. Guess what has that? Most crappy 35% cream that isn't organic. Guess what helps you with your cheese? That.

See, I'm sort of against the roux and the flour. The less you use the better. Thick cream with carrageen? Less flour. That poster is correct. This is why you have to buy 35% cream...besides the fact it's awesome.

And speaking of roux, if you get some Annie's or another boxed mac that has powdered cheese, use it instead of flour. It still accomplishes the same thing as flour. That really is the secret ingredient.",MSG,smacksaw,4,Cooking,2011-04-25 08:03:53 UTC,4,2011

It also had a strong sodium taste.  I don't know if it was the salt or MSG but everyone noticed it and it was hard to eat more than one just for that reason (though we all managed to).  So I'd cut back a tad on the salt and MSG.  I know salty makes them more 'authentic' but without it it would be easier. 

Also the milk and flour mixture are more than enough to do 2 batches of chicken.

"Sigh. I'm going to sound shitty here but the recipe is not very yummy to me. I respect your right to cook however you like and yummy anything you wish. But frankly this recipe seems like a poor version of even simple beef stew. Anything which recommend bouillon cubes and pre-cut supermarket stew beef is going to end up with a poor version of stew.

With just about 10 minutes extra, you can turn out a far superior version. Here's what I would do to improve this.

First, don't buy supermarket stew beef. It's always cheap, bitty cuts from the rump - nasty and livery. Just buy a nice piece of chuck, either a big slab or a nice chuck roast. Cut it up yourself into larger (1-2"" or so) pieces.

Second, don't use cubes - they're just salt and MSG. Find a nice commercial beef stock - Swanson is good. However, if you're going to make this often, invest in some Better than Bullion brand stock base. It's in a small black jar and you can make as little or as much as you like mixing the base with water. Keeps in the fridge for a long time. Many professional chefs use stock base in their recipes.

Now, to start brown the beef cubes in a pot to a very brown color. Do in small batches - if you see a lot of liquid you have too many pieces.

Take out the beef and saute the onions in some oil in the same pan. Scrape up the brown bits. 

When the onions are soft (couple of minutes), deglaze the pan with some of the beef stock (1/4 cup or so) or even better use some nice red wine. Scrape hard to dissolve the brown bits (fond). If you used wine, cook for a few minutes until reduced.

If you like you can now continue the recipe with the beef, browned onions and the little liquid left. Frankly, I would skip the crock all together and finish the recipe on the stove or in the oven. Only takes about 2 hours cooking time.

Thanks and hope my suggestions are taken in the spirit of good cooking.

Do you know the cause of your acid reflux? Acid reflux can be caused by various things, two of the main reasons though are either you have a insufficient amount of acid in your stomach, or else you have too much.

You should look into those or ask your doctor which you have..

Some things to help control the reflux though is eating smaller meals, instead of large ones, no eating a few hours prior to bed time, and staying away from the 'trouble' foods.. I think they're different for everyone. So maybe just keep a food journal :) Also, warm drinks are more likely to cause your esophagus to relax, letting the acid come up. So try to drink cold things =D. I had to get the surgery to fix this once, if you have any more questions feel free to msg me

As for the lactose intolerance, Interesting fact: Most people who have the intolerance are able to eat yogurts. The cultures in the yogurt break down the lactose enzymes which would usually make you feel like shit :)

But if you're wanting straight up probiotics I reccomend going into the health food section and buying the little probiotic capsules. Those are the surefire way of taking them.

Even though yogurt/fortified dairy products claim to have probiotics, usually by the time it gets to the stores and your stomach its already dead.

Fry breakfast sausage, crumble and brown to medium dark, set aside.   Drain grease and discard.   
Fry bacon, drain grease and reserve for frying.   
Fry link sausage to light brown, reserve.   
Fry ham to light brown, reserve.   
Fry chicken and pork to medium brown, reserve.   
Fry trinity until it has some color, reserve.   
Fry tomato paste until slightly darkened, reserve.   
(If frying in standard pan, make sure to deglaze and don't burn tomato paste)  

Bring stock to simmer in pan.   
Add MSG and ham base, check salt (shrimp powder and seasoned meats will also have some salt, so don't oversalt stock).   
Add creole seasoning, bay leaf powder, shrimp powder, Rotel, fried meats, trinity, and tomato paste.   
Bring back to simmer, simmer 5-10 minutes.

Cheats Broth: Use chicken broth powder bought from an Asian grocer. It's 100% salt and an extra 10% MSG. It's not great, but it's fast.

Don't have chilli oil? Take a bunch of dried chilli flakes, cover with peanut oil or another neutral oil (grapeseed oil is awesome). Leave at room temp until the oil is nice and red then refrigerate.

"I find that if you tell people that what they're eating is expensive, [they tend to like it more](http://w4.stern.nyu.edu/emplibrary/jobmarket_paper_plassmann_final.pdf) . It's totally bullshit, but true. Also, try adding a bit of MSG. Seriously.

A good friend of mine went over to Taiwan for school and he worked in the college kitchen. He said they put more MSG into foods than salt and sugar combined and they tasted better than anything he's ever ate in america. Just don't tell anyone, they'll think you're an asshole for ""poising them."" It's all in the head for the most part if you cook a good meal. If you tell them it is more expensive than it really is, they'll think it tastes better. It's sort of like the placebo effect. The brain is a crazy thing.

Edit: Here's what I was trying to get at by that terrible link, ""A 2000 review found that large doses of MSG given without food may elicit more symptoms than a placebo in individuals who believe that they react adversely to MSG. However, the frequency of the responses was low and the responses reported were inconsistent and were not reproducible. The responses were not observed when MSG was given with food.""

" I see, to be honest the flavor you crave actually comes from the MSG and nitrates inherent in the deli meat mixing with the subtle flavors of the tomato on your samich. Maybe South_of_Heaven was on to something,  after cutting or slicing a tomato it's required that it be chilled for service. I imagine your distaste for the gooey seed cells is offset by the fact that pre-sliced tomatoes have a chance to drain and solidify before you munch them.

 If your truly interested in enjoying a tomato at home perhaps you could try pre-slicing and chilling them. Your probably not going to find a true beefsteak variety in the store these days but you could always poke out the seed cells after you slice them if that's what you fancy.

And always remember the true path to tomato euphoria is a dash of salt and pepper.",MSG,[deleted],2,Cooking,2011-09-08 08:43:30 UTC,9,2011

"I looked it up again. The number cited was actually less than 1%. But they claim it just causes headaches from meals with lots of msg (asian products normally have much more). It's absolutely not dangerous in any ways and there's absolutely no proof of any effects that it causes except that it may cause headaches and muscle tightness in less than 1% of the population. Some people do just get headaches from certain foods, it doesn't mean it's bad for you. If someone says it makes them feel headachey I would believe them, but it happens to so few people I wouldn't even worry about it. If they get a headache after the fact without telling them remember not to serve them msg again.

"Ginger is a must...mince it and drop it in your oil before you add the rice will give it a great aroma. Another trick is if you're adding egg, instead of frying it separately just scramble and pour right into the rice while it's frying and start folding over until it cooks.This will give the rice a very nice color (if you're making fried rice without soy sauce).

No MSG.) or with whatever you'd like. Add thyme and green onion and cut up garlic. I let mine sit for 30 to an hour. 

Cube two baking potatoes and one large sweet potatoe. Put to the side. 

Petite carrots and sweet peas (frozen). As well to be added once chicken is finished stewing. 

Brown garlic in oil them add chicken. Fill pot until chicken is covered about an inch. Set to stew. About 1.5 hours. Take off film of oil/blood if you want. 

Add carrots for 30. Then add potatoes with seasoning packet. Last 15 add peas. I have a gas stove so mine cooks rapidly.

Yuck.

Here is a real food recipe:

Saute finely chopped white onions and green pepper until soft. Add ground beef, cook until browned. Remove all and put aside. 

Add 3 tablespoons of butter and 3 tablespoons white flour. Cook until the paste begins to turn golden. Add enough milk until you have a consistency you like (about 1.5 cups). Mix in the same spices from the recipe, plus salt to desired saltiness and enough tomato paste to make it a nice red color (probably 4-5 tablespoons). 

Add back the onions/beef/green pepper mixture. At this point, it'll be a bit chunky, so if you want it smooth, then you can throw this in a tabletop blender or use a stick blender until it's the consistency you want. Put it back on the heat and mix in around 1 cup of your favorite shredded cheese (Jalapeño Jack would be great!) and serve with tortilla chips after the cheese has melted.

"This is not as pretty as stock, but it's very flavorful. If the meat shop dry ages beef, ask them to save the bones and scraps when they break down the primary. Mine charges the same price as normal bones because no one else knows to ask for them.   

You want to greatly increase surface area to ensure that all the tasty stuff dissolves into the water. Put the bones in a strong cloth bag and smash them with the biggest hammer you have access to. No need to obliterate them, just break them into several pieces.    

 If you roast them in the oven make sure to deglaze the pan. I just roast them in the soup pot with the lid on, stirring every few minutes. When they're nearly done, add the vegetables/spices and roast them. As other's have said star anise is also a must. Then stir in some shrimp paste, let it carmelize a bit. I prefer the filipino Bagoong alamang, it adds lots of flavor but it's not as funky. Deglaze with michiu, sake, shochu or dry sherry. then add the cold water. Simmer on low overnight. Do not bring it to a boil. Sieve. Make caramel with your sugar. I just mix water and sugar in a bowl and put it in the microwave at 15-30 second intervals until it browns. Add fish sauce, you shouldn't need msg or salt. Chill and skim. 

There are 2 items which I highly recommend, as a substitute for shrimp paste, though they aren't traditional, only add one. Dried cuttlefish, pulverized in a food processor/blender. Do this a little at a time unless your appliance is powerful. Add it shortly before the veggies.  Sea urchin roe, add it to the hot stock before you serve, that will be enough to cook it.
