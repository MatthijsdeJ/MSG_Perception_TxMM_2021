I didn't specify which type of vinegar, only that it contains it.  The difference in taste comes from the different types of vinegar used in all mayo (which in kewpie is usually apple and malt, I think) and how much, which is a bit more in kewpie (just based on taste, I would guess). Kewpie additionally ABSOLUTELY contains MSG, as well as being a more traditionally French-style mayo, in that it doesn't use whole pasteurized eggs in the emulsion, just the yolks.

It's not a by-product on soy sauce. It is extracted from wheat gluten proteins, at least nowadays. it was originally found in Seaweed, but now there are more efficient ways of producing it.

However, learn to cook rice and beans.

Cook some rice according to the package. When it's about 10 minutes until the rice is done, start *cooking* the rest of this. Start preparing it before the 10 minute mark :)


Chop up an onion and some garlic. Saute them in a bit of oil. Let the onions get ""translucent"". In cooking, ""translucent onions"" means ""let them heat up for a few minutes"". They won't actually be translucent, but whatever.


Get some black beans from a can, and rinse them for a while. That gets a fair bit of the sodium out, as far as I know. 

Now that the onions are cooked a bit, throw the beans in. Throw some salt over the whole thing to enhance the flavor.

At this point, you have a hearty, cheap, filling, and...tasteless dish. You need to add some spices. 

Try throwing Cumin and Chili Powder in with it. Or MSG, such as Goya's Sazon. 

Without the seasonings, this is a very versatile base. You can make taco filling with it, by putting taco seasoning and some meat (such as ground turkey). You can throw some bell peppers in it to make it more colorful and healthy. Plus quite a bit other things I haven't listed.",+,,,

Season as soon as you add the vegetables with a lot of dried thyme, black pepper,  a little dried basil. Salt to taste. When it's done, add shrimp back in. 

4. Sauce is a mix of bechamel and normal Alfredo which doesn't get as greasy when you reheat it. Saute a little mince garlic in butter low heat. Make that into a roux and add milk. 

5. To bechamel add heavy cream and butter. When it's heated, add grated parm. Season with black pepper, cayenne, salt, and nutmeg. I add more cayenne to make it spicy. 

6. Add finished sauce into vegetables and shrimp. Adjust seasonings. Add a little more parsley, red chilli flakes, and a tsp of tomato paste.

274,"When I make tomato sauce, I don't usually add meat.  I'll add meat when I'm making the dish later.  What I do is:

A few cans of San Marzano toms, whole, then mushed up by hand in a big bowl (very satisfying to do)

Cook up some garlic and onion in the pot.  Sweat it like a hot yoga class

Add some very thinly sliced carrot, let it start to soften.  

Deglaze with a bit of red wine

Add toms and bring to a mild simmer

Turn heat down and ride that train for the next 4-5 hours, stirring every 15-30 minutes.  The carrots will disappear if you cut them small enough, but lend a lot of sweetness to the sauce.  

For spices, I tend to add a bit of red pepper flake, rosemary, oregano, and basil.  Fresh, if you can.  

The next big secret apart from carrots that I tell people is *fish sauce*.  You may not be into that depending on how you feel about fish.  But traditionally they would add anchovies and cook them into the sauce - this is replacing that.  It adds some amazing umami-ness and brings out the glutamates in the tomato.  If you really don't want to add fish, I would suggest chopping up some mushroom and adding it with the carrots.  Mushrooms also have a lot of glutamates. And maybe toss a bit of MSG in.  

When I serve, I'll cook up some italian sausage with more onion, bell pepper, mushroom, maybe spinach, and fresh grape tomatoes.  Add the sauce and simmer it all together and serve over pasta.

713,"I make stew once a week in winter and my method is full-proof for great results.  It's not really novice level but not difficult either, just a little more involved (worth it to me).

I dredge my meat (usually use beef short rib or chuck) in flour and brown it in olive oil in my dutch oven.  Brown on all sides.  Remove from pan and set aside.  Do in batches if you are making a lot and/or pan is small.

Add diced onion, garlic, and celery to pan (you shouldn't have to add any more fat, but can if you need it) and saute a few minutes until onions start to go transparent.
 
Then add 2 Tbsp of tomato paste and stir and cook on medium heat until paste has turned dark and is sizzling on bottom of pan. It should be evenly spread out amongst all the veg. This step is very important and can't be skipped.

Then add stock and wine to the pot to create enough liquid to come up 1/2 way on your meat when it's added back in, say about 3 cups total.

At this point I'll add seasonings (for me, Mrs Dash, pepper, a little MSG, and a little cinnamon), stir it in.  A bay leaf would be good too. Unfortunately I can't add any salt.

Then add meat back in, turn heat to low, partially cover pan, and cook for 90 minutes or so.  This part can be done in the oven if you want, but I always use the stove.

After cooling a bit off heat, I take out the meat and either puree the sauce (with an immersion blender) or run it thru a sieve.  I like smooth sauces (the onions etc have given up their flavor to the sauce, what's left is dross in my opinion). I realize this part is more fuss than most people want to do, but the end result is cookbook-picture-worthy in appearance.

At this point I almost always stop and refigerate the sauce and meat separately overnight and finish (and eat) the stew the next day. The braise-cool-reheat cycle makes meat very tender.

The next day I'll return the sauce (which should be very thick almost jelly like) to a pot on medium heat, add whatever veg I want (carrots always, sometimes parsnip, zucchini in the summer, potato if I'm not doing them separate as mashed, whole mushrooms) and cook for an hour or so until the veg is tender but not mushy.  Obviously add delicate veg (eg zucchini, mushroom) towards the end. Also add the meat back in with 20-25 minutes to go and get it down in the juice.  I also add some chopped parsley at same time as meat. (Add more stock/water if you feel there is not enough sauce, especially if you're going the mashed potato route).

That's it.  If I didn't put potatoes in the stew, I'll serve it with mashed potatoes.  The sauce makes a great gravy.

I like splitting it up into 2 parts. Again the cool and reheat really does a number on the meat, it allows the proteins to relax.",+,,,

It’s a huge corporation so they can’t do all of the things listed. Still good just disingenuous to say it’s their actual recipe. ",+,,,

 ____NEXT COMMENT____ 
Quiche is one of those things you can kind of just make with whatever's in the cupboard, but this is a common recipe I use:

Caramelise 2-3 small to medium onions, adding garlic and maybe shallots when they're 3/4 caramelized. Deglaze with water until the final deglaze, then use balsamic vinegar.

While that's going, break 10-12 large eggs in a bowl, and set aside in fridge. Coarsely grate 1.5-2 cups of sharp cheddar, and 50ish grams of parmasianno regiano. Crumble 25-50 grams of blue cheese and cube 50-100 grams goat feta in the bottom of a pie plate.

When the onions are caramelized (this takes no less than 45 minutes) drape them over the cheese.

Grind fresh pepper onto the eggs. No, more, that's not enough. Keep grinding. Add about 1/4-1/2 teaspoon salt and MSG, to taste. Beat eggs well, then mix in the cheddar and half the Parma. Pour eggs and cheese  into the pan and cover other ingredients well. Sprinkle remaining Parma on top, and bake at 350 for 45-60 minutes or until the top is golden brown and a toothpick comes out clean (I just do it by eye).

I'll often throw whatever leftover meat and veggies I have laying around, but be careful not to add too much moisture with the veggies. Broccoli, bacon, ham, chicken are all good choices, as are spicy peppers.

If it sticks to the pan you didn't use enough butter caramelizing the onions.",+,,,
937,"Haven't logged in for a while, so I didn't see this comment sooner, but I respectfully disagree that the recipe is a ""poor version of even simple beef stew"" as you put it.

Maybe my grocery store is different than yours, the pre-cut stew beef works just fine for me.  At times, I'll use chuck, bottom round, or any other beef that I happen to be able to get my hands on, and honestly, after 8-10 hours in the crock pot, it's all beef.

As far as the bouillon cubes go, in the recipe it is suggested that you can use canned broth instead if you prefer.  I have used Better than Bouillon base before, and I agree that stuff is great.  However, it's not available everywhere, I can't get it where I am now.  So I'm stuck with bouillon cubes or canned broth.  I don't always have the broth on hand, but I do usually have bouillon cubes/granules.  While I will readily admit that the sodium content is higher than I'd like, there is no MSG in the cubes I use, and they honestly add a nice flavor.  Not all bouillon cubes are created equal, I suppose.

Your other recommendations for cooking are great for someone who has the time to spend in the kitchen browning the meat in small batches, then sauteing the onions, and such.  I'm sure it makes for a great stew, I just usually don't have the time.  This is why I'm much more of a throw it in the crock pot and let it cook on low until I get home kind of person.

I eat far less processed food than the average person, because I'm allergic to most of it, and I still end up with MSG in quite a few of my meals.

First, your ""marinade"" is mostly water. Leaving chicken in lightly salted water for 20 minutes is not going to have much effect.

Your frying technique is fine, if basic, but you're going to want to season the flour a whole lot more. There are seasonings out there besides salt, pepper, and MSG.

928,"I have known for a long time that I've had a sensitivity to MSG.  It's not so much the MS but the G, glutamate.  It's not only found in MSG but also autolyzed yeast extract, and hydrolyzed proteins (to state the most common).  It also occurs naturally in many basic foods, ie tomatoes or cheese.  

Glutamic acid is found in two isomers, L- and D-.  The D- configuration is the naturally occurring isomer and I have not determined my own sensitivity to it.  The -L isomer results from human processing, and this is the one I need to watch out for.  L- is the chirality of glutamic acid found as a food additive and I, for some reason, am very sensitive to it.  If I ingest a small quantity I have no reaction.  There seems to be some threshold I need to cross before I get one of my blinding migraines.  I've also noticed that increased heart rate through exercise increases my chance to react to glutamate ingestion.  This I attribute to an increased accumulation in brain's blood vessels.  

A recent paper published in Nature Genetics indicates there is a genetic marker for glutamate sensitivity, and the researchers have tied it to migraine-like reactions.  Here's the link to Reuters story: http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE67S1PN20100830  The paper itself requires a subscription but can be easily found from that link.  I have read it, but I don't understand it's detail very much.  Genetics is way over my head, however I am have a PhD in chemical engineering and scientific research is my career.  I used research techniques, and myself as a guinea pig, to determine the cause of my migraines.  This is how I determined MSG or glutamate as the culprit.  

Now I try to avoid glutamic acid as best I can and have reduced my migraine incidents to about one per year.  Nobody can completely avoid glutamate.  Most people aren't sensitive and it's not a bad salt to cook with, just not for me.

316,"To over simplify, the way the food industry in many western countries works is that nutrient barren food is often cheaper to produce (primarily because it has a long shelf live, uses preservatives etc) and that low cost is passed on to the consumer.

Similarly many poorer areas are what is referred to as a ""food dessert"" where you don't find much (if any) fresh produce but instead convenience stores and fast food. In some of these places junk food is often sold cheaper than it is in near by affluent areas; the affluent areas absorb the losses and most purchasing is done in poorer areas. So in essence, many poorer people live in an environment where junk food is both normalised and affordable.

Get a big pan and some (non-microwave) popcorn.

Buy some raw peanuts, put em in a cookie sheet and cook them at 350 for 15 mins then gently shake the pan and give em 15 more minutes.  Fresh peanuts are amazing.

Beans could be a weekly or occasional staple purchase the same with potatoes, cereal and peanut butter.  They are so cheap but can last so long.

I try to go all natural but I buy taco powder (in a big container not envelopes) and cheese powder (for the popcorn it comes in all sorts of flavors.) and those contain MSG.

For produce try to stay under $3.00 per pound unless you have a big influx of cash.  I shoot for  $1.00 a pound but that isn't always feasible.

Beyond that the msg fear stems from a racist opinion article written by a doctor who saw symptoms in his friends after eating Chinese food. The symptoms he described were the same as dehydration. 

The key take away is moderation in all things. ",+,,,

Wouldn't that be funny after all these years if MSG was proven to have cancer fighting properties.",+,,,
479,If you can sneak some horse radish into the mayo not so you taste it but to have it act as a flavour enhancer as you chew. It's like MSG for italian subs.,+,,,
528,"I've got no problem with MSG, but I'd rather get my free glutamic acid from whole, unprocessed foods. If I'm not in a big rush, I'll use tamari, kombu, miso, fresh mushrooms, stock from dried shiitakes, reduced balsamic vinegar, red wine, tomatoes or tomato paste instead to add more flavour (and potentially nutrional content) as well. But I don't shy away from MSG as a last-minute addition or if I don't have time for all that.",+,,,
795,"How could this problem be solved by plant-based dieters though?  


The first challenge is proving the condition exists, and there's literally no way to sort a nocebo/placebo effect from a real but vague health issue without some kind of controlled study.  


That's not the same as a flat-out denial that the condition exists, but it is certainly a skeptical approach. Many people believe they have a sensitivity to grains or MSG when very little evidence exists to support it, and those allergies can both be traced back to either a fake claim (in the case of MSG) or a study that didn't hold up to further research (non-gluten wheat sensitivity, though I realize there is a little more complexity to that issue.)  


And to be clear, it doesn't matter whether the person had doubts or a negative attitude going in; changing your diet in a significant way, especially by eliminating things you like, could always have a mental effect that would be challenging to suss out.  


Before we can diagnose the underlying causes of failure to thrive on a vegan diet, we'd need to prove it's a real condition. I'd love to see people like OP recruited for a blinded study. Design would be a challenge of course, as you'd have to manage to blind a patient to the food they're eating, and you also couldn't actually put ethical vegans in an experimental group where they were given a non-vegan diet. But I'd love to see OP and other ""FTT"" vegans sign up for a study where they are given a diet where the food is all blended into a homogenous shake or difficult-to-identify substance, and they eat that diet for several months. They report how they're feeling, and we see if there is truly a detectable difference between the diets in FTT people.   


Of course I believe OP did poorly on the diet, but nocebo effects aren't ""fake."" They're completely real, and can have physical manifestations, and that's especially true with things like lack of energy.",+,,,
344,"Japanese mayonnaise is typically made with apple cider vinegar or rice vinegar and a small amount of MSG, which gives it a different flavor from mayonnaise made from distilled vinegar. It is most often sold in soft plastic squeeze bottles. Its texture is thinner than most Western commercial mayonnaise.

Apart from salads, it is popular with dishes such as okonomiyaki, takoyaki and yakisoba and may also accompany katsu and karaage. It is sometimes served with cooked vegetables, or mixed with soy sauce or wasabi and used as dips. It is also common in Japan to use mayonnaise on pizza.

Kewpie (Q.P.) is the most popular brand of Japanese mayonnaise, advertised with a Kewpie doll logo. It is made with egg yolks instead of whole eggs, and the vinegar is a proprietary blend containing apple and malt vinegars.

617,"&gt;MSG is a naturally sourced ingredient.

Can we not use this as a metric of what is or isn't healthy/dangerous please? I am not against MSG in the slightest but implying it's fine *because* it's naturally sourced is daft. Plenty of naturally sourced ingredients are harmful or even lethal. ",+,,,

ehh i disagree with msg. maybe a tiny sprinkle but i dont use it myself. i wonder why i got downvotes though lol. i guess people dont like the truth?",.,,,
739,"I used to work at a store that was right next to a very traditional Chinese restaurant and would have customers stop by after lunch there who would tell me how great it was to have a restaurant using fresh ingredients and no msg because they were so sensitive. Meanwhile, I would trip over empty 50 pound bags of the stuff out back by the dumpsters. Seriously. I know the stuff isn't this bad, but the first time you find yourself surrounded by those empty 50 lb sacks of it you kind of worry for a minute if you're going to be that one in a thousand that has some sensitivity.

 ____NEXT COMMENT____ 
There's a teensy percentage of the population who have a reaction to MSG and so now every fifth yuppie is sure they also have this problem. It's trendy to have a food intolerance and MSG is less embarrassing to go with than Celiac disease.

 ____NEXT COMMENT____ 
I don't know what it is that makes people do this but it drives me crazy. One night on the internet and they have every disease on the webmd. 

If you have a mild intolerance, you should probably cut back on the stuff that upsets your body. I get that. But people who decide they have a disease just because they read something that vaguely resembled their symptoms on a website do a terrible disservice to people-like you- who really have one, and are just annoying to everyone else. It's one of my pet peeves. I'll end the rant now because this is really getting off from my original comment, which was mostly that MSG comes in horrifically honking large bags. The fact that people who don't know they're eating it often have zero side effects from their 'MSG intolerance' was mostly just something I found dark humor in.",+,,,
220,"I would suggest not salting the meat until it's time for cooking.  It can start curing the meat.  And for anyone still afraid of MSG, just use some soy, worcestershire or fish sauce.

 ____NEXT COMMENT____ 
Yeah!  That's where I learned about that. And as for all those other suggestions I gave, they all have pretty strong flavors (and MSG for that matter), but I figure for anyone afraid of MSG itself, might as well go for something they're okay with.  I never use them for burgers, but figure someone else might find them useful.

And if you can grind your own meat (food processor works, too, if you do it properly) it's wayyyy better!",+,,,

420,"Here's the ingredients for the Knorr Vegetarian Vegetable Bullion cubes that I get.  You get 6 cubes for $1.something and each cube is (I think) the equivalent of 1 can of broth.

salt, palm oil, monosodium glutamate, autolyzed yeast extract, sugar, onion powder, corn starch, water, dehydrated cabbage, dehydrated carrots, celery seed, caramel color, disodium inosinate, dehydrated parsley, spices, garlic powder, citric acid, turmeric (for color), partially hydrogenated soybean oil, tbhq (used to protect quality)

If any of that isn't vegetarian, do let me know.  It would obviously be much better for you to make your own but this can be pretty convenient.  ",.,,,
