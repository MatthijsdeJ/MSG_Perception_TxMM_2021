372,"Respectfully, this recipe needs some work.

First, your ""marinade"" is mostly water. Leaving chicken in lightly salted water for 20 minutes is not going to have much effect. It seems like this is closer to an attempt at brining the chicken, but you'll need more salt than 1 tbsp to 4 cups of water for that to be effective, and you would want to brine for at least a few hours, if not overnight.

Your frying technique is fine, if basic, but you're going to want to season the flour a whole lot more. There are seasonings out there besides salt, pepper, and MSG.

This reads like a simplified fried chicken recipe for beginners, and it doesn't really feature anything that elevates it to ""restaurant quality.""

EDIT: OP kind of seems like a bot based off their history, so I'm not sure there's much point in this response. ",.
10,"Natural and synthetic msg are different things. Thanks for the grade 9 science lesson though. Very helpful and not condescending at all. And I'm not talking about a ""oh I'm a little dehydrated and dizzy"" reaction that is mostly bs and mass hysteria against Chinese restaurants. When I eat something with added msg I am violently ill for 4-6 hours after.

I've seen people on this sub claim being allergic to msg isn't a real thing.... But it definitely is and adding it to people's food without their knowledge could lead to them having a really bad day.

 ____NEXT COMMENT____ 
The form present in common foods doesn't contain the bonding agents used in the additive. So sure technically you're correct, but practically its way easier to say ""I'm allergic/intolerant to msg"" than dive into what exactly I'm allergic to.

 ____NEXT COMMENT____ 
I'm pretty much done with this thread because y'all seem to think ""rare"" is the same thing as ""impossible"". It took 4 months of randomly getting sick and tracking ingredient lists to figure out what caused the reaction and I still will occasionally get sick at potlucks when I eat usually ""safe"" food that unexpectedly turns out to have msg in it. And that conclusion was drawn by a physician not myself so feel free to continue discounting anything that goes against your narrative :). I'm not denying a ton of people have bullshit reactions to the Chinese restaurant myth, but you're an idiot if you think that means literally no person can have a reaction to MSG.",.
928,"I have known for a long time that I've had a sensitivity to MSG.  It's not so much the MS but the G, glutamate.  It's not only found in MSG but also autolyzed yeast extract, and hydrolyzed proteins (to state the most common).  It also occurs naturally in many basic foods, ie tomatoes or cheese.  

Glutamic acid is found in two isomers, L- and D-.  The D- configuration is the naturally occurring isomer and I have not determined my own sensitivity to it.  The -L isomer results from human processing, and this is the one I need to watch out for.  L- is the chirality of glutamic acid found as a food additive and I, for some reason, am very sensitive to it.  If I ingest a small quantity I have no reaction.  There seems to be some threshold I need to cross before I get one of my blinding migraines.  I've also noticed that increased heart rate through exercise increases my chance to react to glutamate ingestion.  This I attribute to an increased accumulation in brain's blood vessels.  

A recent paper published in Nature Genetics indicates there is a genetic marker for glutamate sensitivity, and the researchers have tied it to migraine-like reactions.  Here's the link to Reuters story: http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE67S1PN20100830  The paper itself requires a subscription but can be easily found from that link.  I have read it, but I don't understand it's detail very much.  Genetics is way over my head, however I am have a PhD in chemical engineering and scientific research is my career.  I used research techniques, and myself as a guinea pig, to determine the cause of my migraines.  This is how I determined MSG or glutamate as the culprit.  

Now I try to avoid glutamic acid as best I can and have reduced my migraine incidents to about one per year.  Nobody can completely avoid glutamate.  Most people aren't sensitive and it's not a bad salt to cook with, just not for me.

**tl;dr** Some people are sensitive to MSG.  A recent publication in Nature Genetics is supportive of this claim.",.
316,"To over simplify, the way the food industry in many western countries works is that nutrient barren food is often cheaper to produce (primarily because it has a long shelf live, uses preservatives etc) and that low cost is passed on to the consumer. I work in a super market and a single apple at my work is 35p (UK) but for 50p you could get a pack of noodles (super noodles) which are high in additives such as msg. Which would you choose if you were on a tight budget? Similarly many poorer areas are what is referred to as a ""food dessert"" where you don't find much (if any) fresh produce but instead convenience stores and fast food. In some of these places junk food is often sold cheaper than it is in near by affluent areas; the affluent areas absorb the losses and most purchasing is done in poorer areas. So in essence, many poorer people live in an environment where junk food is both normalised and affordable. Also junk food is typically less filling and calorie dense (meaning you need to eat more to be satiated. Therefore, yes poorer people often can afford to over eat due to the way companies target them and unfortunately this also means higher levels of obesity are associated with lower income areas. ",.
706,"Very authentic, except I think it can be done without the Ajinomoto, instead using as you suggest salt, or some seafood.",.
408,"You know who *doesn't* have gluten allergies, sensitivity to MSG, lactose intolerance, and a host of other food ailments that have little or no basis in provable facts?

Practically everyone on the planet but upper-income Americans. Hmmmm...

I'm not saying there aren't any people with legitimate problems, including the ones above. What I *am* saying is that 99% of the people who claim to have those ailments are hypochondriacs and/or attention whores. For instance, they eat some cheese that makes them fart a bit, and suddenly they're announcing to the world that they are lactose intolerant.",.
435,"The phrase ""Chinese restaurant syndrome"" was not coined by the NEJM. It was coined in an article based on hearsay and anecdotal evidence, which happened to be published in the NEJM over 40 years ago. That is not the same thing as the journal endorsing its existence.


""Blind taste tests"" aren't blind, because MSG has such a strong natural flavor. If you can taste it, you're not effectively blinded to it. The only way to do a blind trial of MSG sensitivity is to put it in capsules (with some capsules containing placebo). Was your trial conducted that way?


Also, kombu is full of naturally derived MSG, so if you can eat foods containing kombu broth, then you're not sensitive to MSG. This ""cooking out"" thing has no basis in chemistry.

625,"Good to know. On the cannister it's advertised as a salt substitute, so I was going down the wrong path to begin with. And despite how much people rave about MSG online, no one ever really talks about the specifics of how to use it, and it's too stigmatised to appear in recipes.",.
347,And MSG.,.

614,"I loved Aromat as a kid, however I now know it's little more than just salt and artificial flavor-enhancer (MSG), so it's quite an unnecessary thing to eat. ",.
434,"That is a good start.  Weekly, buy beans, chicken, eggs, pasta, bread, cheese, yogurt milk cereal and tons of fresh fruits, and veggies.  Get managers special(old) cuts of non-chicken meat and freeze it right away.  Every so often stock up on staples like flour, oil, butter, baking soda/powder, corn starch, peanut butter, rice, spices, sauces condiments.

Get a big pan and some (non-microwave) popcorn.

Buy some raw peanuts, put em in a cookie sheet and cook them at 350 for 15 mins then gently shake the pan and give em 15 more minutes.  Fresh peanuts are amazing.

Beans could be a weekly or occasional staple purchase the same with potatoes, cereal and peanut butter.  They are so cheap but can last so long.

I try to go all natural but I buy taco powder (in a big container not envelopes) and cheese powder (for the popcorn it comes in all sorts of flavors.) and those contain MSG.

For the veggies I would suggest frozen peas, broccoli, cauliflower, carrots and corn.  For fresh; cucumber, carrots, broccoli cauliflower tomatoes avocado celery and peppers.

For the fruit apples, (tons of) bananas (until you can't stand them), oranges and the occasional fresh berry (and frozen berries which are cheaper unless it's the season).

Don't forget mushrooms they are expensive per pound but a pound of mushrooms is huge. Crimini white or if on sale Portabella are the way I go.

For produce try to stay under $3.00 per pound unless you have a big influx of cash.  I shoot for  $1.00 a pound but that isn't always feasible.

You want mostly produce.  You can change out bread for tortillas they can be more expensive but they add some versatility.  Read your labels.  You want as little fake crap as possible.  Don't do diet or low fat anything it's fake garbage (I do get diet Dr. Thunder but he's a doctor.)  If you need to lighten up your diet fill up on fruits and veggies. When buying yogurt (or if you splurge cottage cheese).  Read the labels they fill those full of so much fake crap.

I feed my self and my pregnant wife on $45 a week.  About once a month I spend $100 getting staples (and probably other crap too.)

Obviously you can't get everything here for $45 all at once but it gives variety.  So you have to toy with it.  Figure out milk, egs, meat, cheese and bread cost then go buy the rest in produce.

Google lets you type in ingredients and it will suggest recipes IIRC it's that simple.

Go into the store with the exact amount of cash you want to spend and go to it.",.
411,"To me when curries/stew taste bland is because I made these mistakes. 
1) forgot to season properly. Seems stupid, but not using enough salt may be the reason
2) too much water/ stock is always better 
3)try to use an umami booster: add marmite, sardines, fish sauce, tomato paste, even MSG if necessary",.
1,"According to [this website](http://www.hilary.com/features/msg.html) that kind of has a hate on for MSG here is a list of stuff that ""ALWAYS contain MSG:""

    * Hydrolyzed protein (any protein that is hydrolyzed)
    * Textured protein
    * Glutamate
    * Monopotassium glutamate
    * Glutamic acid
    * Calcium and sodium caseinate

    * Autolyzed yeast
    * Yeast nutrient
    * Gelatin
    * Accent and Zest
    * Glutavene
    * Glutacyl

I think I've seen a lot of these foods in candy bars and ice cream...  I'm certainly not saying MSG is bad but if you or people you know are sensitive to this sort of thing I'd be curious if you have had any reactions to these things.

I wanted to keep this list under 25 items but there are more and some people will use more or less of something depending on what food they like to eat.

If you can get ""smoked"" (spice) I usually like the flavor of them a bit more than (spice) regular but YMMV.

795,"How could this problem be solved by plant-based dieters though?  


The first challenge is proving the condition exists, and there's literally no way to sort a nocebo/placebo effect from a real but vague health issue without some kind of controlled study.  


That's not the same as a flat-out denial that the condition exists, but it is certainly a skeptical approach. Many people believe they have a sensitivity to grains or MSG when very little evidence exists to support it, and those allergies can both be traced back to either a fake claim (in the case of MSG) or a study that didn't hold up to further research (non-gluten wheat sensitivity, though I realize there is a little more complexity to that issue.)  


And to be clear, it doesn't matter whether the person had doubts or a negative attitude going in; changing your diet in a significant way, especially by eliminating things you like, could always have a mental effect that would be challenging to suss out.  


Before we can diagnose the underlying causes of failure to thrive on a vegan diet, we'd need to prove it's a real condition. I'd love to see people like OP recruited for a blinded study. Design would be a challenge of course, as you'd have to manage to blind a patient to the food they're eating, and you also couldn't actually put ethical vegans in an experimental group where they were given a non-vegan diet. But I'd love to see OP and other ""FTT"" vegans sign up for a study where they are given a diet where the food is all blended into a homogenous shake or difficult-to-identify substance, and they eat that diet for several months. They report how they're feeling, and we see if there is truly a detectable difference between the diets in FTT people.   


Of course I believe OP did poorly on the diet, but nocebo effects aren't ""fake."" They're completely real, and can have physical manifestations, and that's especially true with things like lack of energy.",.
344,"Japanese mayonnaise is typically made with apple cider vinegar or rice vinegar and a small amount of MSG, which gives it a different flavor from mayonnaise made from distilled vinegar. It is most often sold in soft plastic squeeze bottles. Its texture is thinner than most Western commercial mayonnaise.

Apart from salads, it is popular with dishes such as okonomiyaki, takoyaki and yakisoba and may also accompany katsu and karaage. It is sometimes served with cooked vegetables, or mixed with soy sauce or wasabi and used as dips. It is also common in Japan to use mayonnaise on pizza.

Kewpie (Q.P.) is the most popular brand of Japanese mayonnaise, advertised with a Kewpie doll logo. It is made with egg yolks instead of whole eggs, and the vinegar is a proprietary blend containing apple and malt vinegars.

I don't know what it is that makes people do this but it drives me crazy. One night on the internet and they have every disease on the webmd. 

If you have a mild intolerance, you should probably cut back on the stuff that upsets your body. I get that. But people who decide they have a disease just because they read something that vaguely resembled their symptoms on a website do a terrible disservice to people-like you- who really have one, and are just annoying to everyone else. It's one of my pet peeves. I'll end the rant now because this is really getting off from my original comment, which was mostly that MSG comes in horrifically honking large bags. The fact that people who don't know they're eating it often have zero side effects from their 'MSG intolerance' was mostly just something I found dark humor in.",.
